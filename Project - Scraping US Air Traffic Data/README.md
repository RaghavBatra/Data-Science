# Project - Scraping US Air Traffic Data

## Overview
As part of my own research, fuelled by Udacity's course content on Data Wrangling, 
I decided to make use of my new-found skills to scrap a lot of the data of the US Bureau 
of Transportation Statistics, namely information about statistics regarding major airports and the carriers 
travelling through them.  

The purpose of this project is **NOT** to answer questions about airports and planes; 
rather, the focus of the project is on understanding how to get the data, even when it's freely available as a webpage.
No doubt, statistics about the airports and carriers can be carried, but that is a secondary focus.
