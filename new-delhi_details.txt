ABOUT:
Delhi is the capital city of India and is regarded as the heart of the nation. 
The city is popular for its enriched culture and heritage. The city hosts some 
famous historical monuments and is developing with the passing of time. 

The influence of religious diversity can be seen in the city along with the 
cultural impact of the Mughal, the ancient Indian and the British. There are 
many beautiful gardens in the city, away from pollution and busy city life that 
provide opportunities to walk leisurely in the midst of greenery.

REASON FOR CHOOSING:
I chose New Delhi because it is my home town, and I was interested 
to see how linguistic differences in how we speak here affected the
dataset.
