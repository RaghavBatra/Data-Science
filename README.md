# Data Science projects

## Overview
Given here are a set of projects that I had to complete for my **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**. 
What you can also see here are some extra projects I set out to do myself. 
I have also cleaned a lot of the projects required for the nanodegree.

All of the projects deal with some aspect of data science, namely:
* Data Wrangling
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning
* Natural Language Processing
* Descriptive Statistics
* Inferential Statistics
* Web Scraping

The languages used are:
* Python
