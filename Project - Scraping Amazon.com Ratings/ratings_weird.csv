"66",5,731577,TRUE,"I'm not going to say why I cried, because that would spoil the whole book (warning: DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT read the review: Harry Potter Rocks! A Kid's Review. It gives away the ending!) But, I will say that that ending made me CRY! And I'm nearly 21 years old.How does one go about describing the Harry Potter books? They're almost indescribable! These books are so full of every emotion, every type of person and creature. They draw you in as the pensieve does into one's thoughts. As Harry witnesses Snape's worst memory (and trust me, you like I will actually feel sympathy towards Snape, believe me!) it is as though he is standing right there amongst his father, Sirius, Lupin and Wormtail. This is how I feel when I read these books. I feel as though I am right there with Harry, Ron and Hermione through every struggle, every injustice, every adventure no matter how dark or hopeless. I cry their tears, I burn with their sense of injustice, my heart leaps with theirs at every victory.But on to the story. The 5th year is the worst yet, no one will admit that You-Know-Who is back, all summer long The Prophet is making Harry look like an attention-grabbing, lying lunatic. Meanwhile, Harry has not seen his friends or Dumbledore all summer, and when they write they are incredibly vague, understandably frustrating after all the horrors Harry witnessed at the end of his 4th year. Then, before you know it, he is under magical attack on Privet Drive!Matters don't improve, Harry risks being expelled from no fault of his and Hogwarts is now under strict control from the Ministry of Magic, led by none other than the blind-to-all-facts Cornelius Fudge. Hagrid has disappeared and Harry is thwarted left and right in all the things he loves and needs to do!I don't understand how anyone could say that these books have been going downhill since the last 150 pages of year 4!? In my opinion, Prisoner of Azkaban was the best yet after years 1 & 2 and Goblet of Fire was better still! This book now is more on the lines of the end of Goblet of Fire, things are getting darker and more ominous and more difficult for everyone. And this is appropriate! With the return of the Dark Lord (eww) we must naturally expect that life will no longer be as fun. But lighten up, there are some truly funny scenes, and a little romance too! But, times are just not as carefree (if they could ever be called so) as they used to be.Someone said that Harry has no sense of humor anymore. I ask you, would you be full of laughs if you had seen the return of free magic's WORST ENEMY, seen someone die and then have to endure a year of people not believing you, teachers trying to discredit you, people you liked turning against you, insanity charges, visions of You-Know-Who doing his dirty work, all your favorite things being taken away? How would you feel if you thought all the world was against you??? These are the struggles Harry must endure, he is run through the mill, his limits are tested to the max, and we all must hope that he is able to survive it all. I'm not sure I could take it and I'm presently 6 years older than him! As they say, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, this will be Harry's test in the future books.Seems so real, doesn't it? Rowling has a style that makes you believe she is writing a biography! But it's more like watching a film of someone's life and walking right into that film and feeling every single thing that they feel, being in the same dangers, loving and caring about the same friends and almost-family. It's really like what Harry felt when he looked through Voldemort's (shudder) eyes and felt what he was feeling, did what he did but was powerless to stop it.Harry is tested to his limit in the Order of the Phoenix, he endures things no human should have to suffer, and he will receive a warning that may change his views and way of life forever. I don't envy poor Dumbledore, on his shoulders seems to rest the weight of the world, and now Harry must truly shoulder some of that weight. Dumbledore can no longer protect Harry from the worst, and in trying to protect him from the ultimate truth up to this point, Dumbledore may have made a very grave and horrible mistake.This book is wonderful, heart-breaking, astounding, depressing, and truly amazing all at the same time. World-Class author, kudos Ms. Rowling! How could I ever have been skeptical of these books??? They are now amongst my ALL-TIME favorites! I hope book 6 is released soon, I'm not sure I can stand the wait!",FALSE,2004,1856
"71",5,731259,TRUE,"So... now that the tumult and the shouting have largely died, what is left to say about this book?  Some readers who devoured the first four Potter books with delight had a problem with this one.  It's... well... different.  And some readers can't handle different.  What's happened to Harry?  Well, adolescence has happened, and in a big way.  He's fifteen now, midway between childhood and manhood; it's a difficult age for anyone, and probably more so if you've had a homicidal wizard on your case for the last four years.  Sure, Harry's moody, irritable, downright unbearable at times, who wouldn't be, if they were in his shoes?  And so we find Harry at the opening of HP5 in his usual midsummer funk, desperate to get back to Hogwarts and away from the loathsome Dursleys.  But this time, the dark forces after Harry are getting a tad impatient; they don't want to wait for him to return to Hogwarts before raising all kinds of cain; the dreaded Dementors attack Dudley right in his own backyard.  Driven off by Harry in the nick of time (one wonders why Harry didn't just let the Dementors get Dudley -- and how did Aunt Petunia know what the Dementors were anyway??), Harry finds himself hauled before the Ministry of Magic charged with violating the laws against underage wizardry.  But he's vindicated by Dumbledore's intervention in his behalf and spends the rest of the summer prior to his return to Hogwarts at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, an intrepid group of wizards out to thwart the evil machinations of Voldemort and his demonic adherents, meeting in the home of Harry's godfather Sirius Black.  We find out the fascinating tidbit that not only are most of the wizarding families related to each other by blood or marriage, but Black himself is related to -- of all people -- the evil Malfoy clan.We remember in Book Three that ditzy Professor of Divination Trelawney, in the middle of one of her interminable reading of the tea-leaves that looked like so much mush to Harry, Ron and Hermione (Divination wasn't one of their best subjects) all of a sudden went into a fit and made one of her few geniune predictions: that Voldemort would return ""greater and more terrible than before"".  She wasn't kidding.  He's back, all right, along with some of his most dangerous followers whom he's managed to spring from Azkaban, and they're all out for blood, Harry's especially.Some new faces are introduced in this volume; we meet Sirius's incredible mother, a vicious harpy who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like a choir girl; a pink-haired punk rocker in the Order of the Phoenix named Nymphadora Tonks (""Wow! a FIREBOLT!?"" she gasps when she sees Harry's broom; making us wonder if a Firebolt is the Lamborghini of broomsticks); a somewhat spacy fourth-year Hogwarts student named Luna Lovegood (no wonder she's called ""Loony"") who, weird though she appears, is the only person who seems to understand where Harry is coing from; and, overshadowing all, a pint-sized witch named Dolores Umbridge, oozing evil from every rotten pore, who usurps Dumbledore's position at Hogwarts as Headmistress and seems to be on a personal mission from Voldemort to do Harry and his friends in.  But Harry isn't going down without a fight; he and his friends form their own secret group to learn advanced defenses against the dark arts, which they will put to good use in the book's climactic conflict in the Minister of Magic when they come face to face with Voldemort and some of his more unsavory adherents.Besides having to deal with the noxious Umbridge (one really wants to tie a bag of firecrackers to this lady and watch her explode), Harry has enough on his plate just being fifteen with a crushing course load and a crush on Cho Chang, who turns out to be as shallow as she is pretty.  It's an endearing characteristic of Harry that, skilled as he is in wizardry, he doesn't have a clue about girls (asked by Ron to describe his first kiss with Cho, he says ""wet""), and when Hermione tries to explain to him how Cho feels when he talks about other girls to her, she might as well be speaking Tagalog.  Harry also has to come to terms, like all adolescents, that at least one of his parents wasn't the paragon he imagined him to be; when he inadvertently blunders on Snape's worst memory, and discovers why Snape hated his father so much, we empathize with his shock at realizing that Potter Sr. was a world-class jerk at fifteen.  (Like most fifteen-year-olds, he grew out of it.)Rowling left a lot of threads hanging at the end of Book Five and this bothered a lot of readers, but it only left this one on tenterhooks waiting for Books Six and Seven.  We suspected from the beginning that it will finally come down to a fight to the finish between Harry and Voldemort, but all kinds of delightful subplots are pending in the meantime.  And some of her minor characters, especially Neville Longbottom, are developing in all kinds of interesting and unexpected ways.  Yes, someone close to Harry dies, and probably everyone and his brother knows who it is by now, but just in case there is someone out there who is still clueless, I'm not saying who.  Just let Rowling keep the magic coming through two more books, and after Book Seven is finally released, I will be among the multitudes clamoring for a sequel.  There just can't be a world without Harry Potter.",FALSE,2003,1538
"74",5,731191,TRUE,"I was lucky enough to be in Britain at midnight, June 21/22, when every child and half the adults of Harry's native land appeared to be at bookstores grabbing HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX off the shelves.  Having a long series of train journeys that weekend, I finished its hefty 870 pages in under 36 hours.  As I did so, I imagined millions of readers just like me, unable to put the book down, delighted that Rowling's creative imagination continues to astonish, and that Harry's story yet again takes us into country we could hardly imagine.Harry's different almost from the first pages of this book - all those adolescent traumas we recall, the sense of rage and frustration at being treated like a child when the young adult demands attention, the worries about Voldemort and what appears to be a conspiracy to undermine Dumbledore and others fighting against him, his own insecurities, the stupidity of the Ministry of Magic which, ostrich-like, keeps its head in the sand and refuses to accept that the Wizarding World is once again in terrible danger.  Throughout, he must focus on ""what to do with the rest of his life,"" with the upcoming O.W.L. examinations which lead inevitably to a grown-up career.  The 'good guys' (including Sirius, Mad-Eye Moody, Lupin, and several new characters) who belong to the ""Order of the Phoenix"" turn out to be both more and less than Harry had once believed.  Good and bad are now seen in shades of grey, not black and white.  Most importantly, Harry discovers something about his father that upsets him terribly, and although we know that the truth is not yet fully revealed, his sense of insecurity is palpable.  Hogwarts itself is taken over by those who will stifle the truth at any cost and Dumbledore seems powerless to stop it.  The split between fighting Voldemort and those denying he exists even strikes the Weasley family, and the book ends with a bitter and terrifying battle in which a major character is betrayed to Voldemort's never-ending efforts to destroy.  Yet with all the dangers, the book finds its own positive ending in which much has been lost, but the best remains.Amidst these serious challenges, Rowling's light-hearted imagination triumphs, full of wonderful images of bad-hearted house-elves, getting pesky doxies out of the curtains thanks to Gilderoy's Lockhart's ""Guide to Household Pests,"" the final comeuppance of the infuriating Inquisitor, Dolores Jane Umbridge (one of the best villain-esses ever penned), career-announcements such as ""HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURUITY TROLLS?"" and infinitely more.  Meanwhile, Harry learns that he can find sympathy even for Professor Snape and the Dursleys, while his true friendships are what will help him survive as we travel deeper into the perils of Voldemort. The Disillusionment Charm works both ways.While the humor and imagination is still triumphantly in evidence, HP5 continues Harry's journey into adulthood with sensitivity, understanding, humor, fright, change and loss. The boy who comes out of the book is still the Harry we love, but strengthened, older, and learning all the time.  Meanwhile, Voldemort is even more frightening and the challenges our heroes face are no longer those of childhood.As in all her books, Rowling shows an amazing sensitivity to the concerns of our young heroes in each stage of their Hogwarts life.  I can't believe Rowling pulled it off AGAIN (after all the doubts and the long wait) but she's as surely on the right track as ever, and now we must all wait with unbelievable impatience to see what Harry Does Next.",FALSE,2003,1470
"79",3,731184,TRUE,"Sigh.When JK Rowling was a miserable, divorced welfare mother, she wrote about a beautiful, magical world that was fun to escape to.  There were exciting landscapes & buildings, funny magical creatures, a school that everyone would want to attend, etc.  Harry, a Dickensonian type orphan, was able to escape to this world and find friends, prizes, and glory.  The writing was in a charming, chatty style, that lingered lyrically on the better parts of the wizarding world.  Leisurely descriptions were intermingled with tightly written suspense and action.  Ahh...Now JK Rowling is richer than the Queen of England, has a new marriage and a new baby.  Now she feels free to explore the darker side of this magical world and Harry's adolescent crisis.  She also is feeling somewhat burdened by the pressure to get these books out.  The result?  Harry is in a bad temper.  He has too much homework.  Not only do the Dursley's torture him, he is tortured in detention.  He snaps at his friends.  They bicker with each other.  He feels terribly sorry for himself.  He is misunderstood.There are few if any funny, happy scenes in this book.  Harry wins no prizes and gets no glory.  Fortunately, at least Ron does, which is nice.Unlike JK Rowling, I have not passed into a better life.  I was still hoping for a beautiful escape.  The beginning of this book was so dismal I almost gave up on it.  Though, having waited so long for it, I had to plug along.The action did start really picking up in Chapter 16, so I was glad I had continued.The writing style for the action parts is still nice and tight -- definitely a page turner.  Unfortunately, the leisurely descriptions are reserved for Harry being tortured rather than for romantic views of the castle or charming magical creatures.  You can't criticize Rowling's style at all.  She's a great writer.  She's just in a different place from me now.I hope this isn't a spoiler, but the ending is hardly happy.  In an interview, JK Rowling asked a reporter about Harry, ""What makes you think he'll survive?""  I'm not sure anyone took her seriously at the time, but after this book you'll certainly have to.  If you are reading this to a young child, you may want to read ahead and reconsider.  I can imagine some kids being upset.Sigh.I think I'm still hooked.  I'll have to find out what happens in the next ones.JK:  Please don't kill Harry, Ron or Hermione off.  OK?  PLEEEEZE!!!Addendum:  The book does have some useful parts for teaching kids about dealing with anger.",FALSE,2003,1463
"80",5,731222,TRUE,"I am still reeling from the final pages of this book, as I'm sure most readers will be. The 5th book in the Harry Potter series is quite a bit darker than the other four. While it takes off like a shot with Harry and his cousin Dudley being attacked by Dementors, the next half of the book is filled with frustration. Harry and Dumbledore are being publicly slandered by the Ministry of Magic, who seek to control every aspect of the wizarding world, including Hogwarts. They even install a horrific little witch as an Inquisitor to make sure everything is running according to Ministry standards. All this while Voldemort is on the loose!It was only when I'd reached the height of MY frustration with the book and the near disintegration of happiness at Hogwarts that I realized what JK Rowling was up to. She brilliantly takes the reader on a ride through Harry's life. Just as he was expecting his 5th year at Hogwarts to be a wonderful escape from the mundanity of the Muggle world, so was I. And as Harry grows more and more frustrated with the Ministry of Magic's manipulations within Hogwarts, so did I. I completely empathized with everything Harry was going through, and I even became angry with Rowling, thinking, ""Why did she do this? Why is she making this happen?"" And then I realized what a HUGE message she was trying to convey: The Ministry of Magic (it seems to me) is very much like a governmental force. And in this book, the Ministry become very dictatorial. Even Dumbledore admits to making the mistake of incarcerating Sirius and Harry in their homes for their own protection, and he's not a party to the Ministry (thank heavens)! The whole book rings with the importance of freedom and being free to make one's own decisions. But it also speaks about knowledge and secrets, and the need we all have to know what's going on in our world. I really feel this book is a huge commentary on what's going on in the real world. It's almost eerie. And it's brilliant, and I would recommend it to anyone who has been shying away from it. It will break your heart, it will make you think, it will make you dream and hope, and there are moments (thank god for Fred and George) that you will laugh. It is a fantastic book.",FALSE,2003,1501
"85",4,731196,TRUE,"I've been a fan of HP since quite some time and waiting for this book was not easy, although never an option.In this 5th installment of the series, we see a more deep, dark side of Harry. He's more angsty than before, and although not as noble in some levels, he is still noble and trying to do the right thing.Some reviewers bashed Harry's ""arrogance"" and angster, I, however see it differently.Harry is 15 now, he is a teenager, asn apparently some of the reviwers forgot what it means to be a teenager. Me, being 22, still remember how full of anger I was, to the point where not even I could stand myself. So for me Harry's behavior is more than understandable. And considering what he has been through, I would dare to say that he took many things rather well.In this book HP notices how things dont always work with what is right. How unfair the world can be, and how short life is. He faces death is a more personal level, and I have to agree with another reviwer that said that a particular death in the book was very much below the belt since Harry has gone through way too much to add a death that is simply heartbreaking.Ron and Hermione are their ususal self, but if they keep fighting I might smack them both in the head.A new character (one of many) is introduced. Her name is Luna ""Loony"" Lovegood. She is so adorable an so weird, but she is extremely likeable.Hagrid's bits in the book were quite boring, i must painfully admit. But Umbridge makes up for this seldom bits.Dumbledore's character is also more elaborated. We get to see another side of his, and a side that can be viewed as weak, but I only see it as human, which only adds to the list of reasons why Voldemort only fears Dumbledore.Overall the book was fantastic, but more depressive and sad, than any of the other. I have to agree with JK in why did she made it so dark and that is because as we grow older life starts to lose it's fairness and we start seeing things under a different light, just as Harry is learning to.Poor Harry his journey is still not over, and more diffucult than probably anyone I know including myself.",FALSE,2003,1475
"87",5,731192,TRUE,"The day ""The Order of the Phoenix"" came into our home, it immediately became a volleyball between myself, my wife and my 8 year old son.  Woe betide the person who put this book down to grab a bite to eat or something to drink, because it would be immediately snatched up for avid reading by one of the other two.After several days (and one SERIOUSLY late night of reading), I just finished the book............EXCELLENT!Ms. Rowling's writing is improving with each book (which is to say nothing at all bad about the writing in the first one).  In ""The Order of the Phoenix"", I think she has wonderfully captured the rollercoaster of emotions that Harry goes through as an adolescent male.The story is getting more intricate (and darker) and the characters are developed nicely.  I particularly like the attention she gave to deepening both Ron and Hermione (and WHEN are THEY going to kiss?!?  Clearly there seems to be some mutual attraction developing between the two of them. :-)The magic is marvelous and the spells are spectacular.  A slight aside, I continue to be amazed at how Harry continues to struggle with trusting Dumbledore......and withholding information from him.  Dumbledore has saved Harry countless times, so the trust seems well-placed.  Personally, I think it's time to lay this literary device to rest.And yes, one of the characters dies.  A loss to the story line, but (whew!) not one of my favorites......All in all, just a wonderful read.I can't wait for the next volume to come out and I wish ""The Order of the Phoenix"" was longer.I can't think of any higher praise.Thank you, Ms. Rowling for the sweat and tears that went into this book!Cheers!",FALSE,2003,1471
"88",5,731190,TRUE,"The evolution of these series has gone from naive and maniqueist utopia to dark dystopia. As the world of magic seems to resemble more and more the world it inhabits (since we are all muggles, that is our world), a subtextual (an sometimes not so hidden discussion) emerges about class, race, slave labor and corruption. Since the second book, where we heard for the first time the racial slur ""mudblood"", this has become the center of the main conflict of the series. Race relations, racism and the pretense of purity are at the heart of the confrontation between the forces of good and evil. It is no surprise that this topic which is painfully present in the political debates all over Europe (with its history of Nazism and the resurgence of a Neo Nazi movement) has become the underlying conflict of the series. For the first time, the sorting hat gives us the real dirt on what lies behind the house divisions at Hogwarts, and it is racism what it talks about. As always, the humor is there, we even find ourselves in the presence of a tabloid newspaper ""The Quibbler"" which is no better than our muggle tabloids, and with it a parody, too close for comfort, of the role of the media, which had begun to take form also in ""The Goblet of Fire"".I particularly recommend a close reading of the description that Sirius Black does about his family and the family ties among the wizards. Nobody reading that chapter can escape the sensation that the analogy with the nazi philosophy is just below the surface.I certainly think that adults should read this series, because there is much to be discussed there, and much to be learned. I am glad that the Dickensian aspect of Rawling's series has gone beyond the most obvious traits and into a discussion of our society and what we have inherited from our recent past.Bravo!",FALSE,2003,1469
"89",5,731189,TRUE,"(This is a spoiler-free review.) Rowling's done it again--another standout book in the Harry Potter series. The fifth book--The Order of the Phoenix--lives up to the reputation of its predecessors and then some. In by far the darkest of the five tales, Harry faces more than just his nemesis Voldemort. Harry must face his own inner demons while coping with some more typically teenage issues.To be honest, I thought Harry a bit too angry for parts of the book--I kept wanting him to snap out of it and think more rationally. But when I think back to when I was fifteen--I don't know how much more logical my own thought would have been. So in that sense, Rowling does capture the turmoil of the teenage years brilliantly. I did enjoy Neville having a larger role in this book--I hope we continue to see more of him. I was a bit confused by the Luna character--not quite sure what we're meant to make of her. The villainous Dolores Umbridge (I do love Rowling's play-on-words) is wonderful and Snape continues to the be the most fantastic character you love to hate. Of course there is the one character who dies...very sad, I will miss that character greatly. The club set up by Harry and pals is really quite good and Draco Malfoy's continued annoying presence is always good for a laugh.  It was indeed great to see the staff all pulling together to support one another and Hogwarts when it was truly needed. And needless to say--Dumbledore is amazing!I read the book through in less than two days (and enjoyed every page, it was just so good!)--and now of course I am sorry I did so, seeing as it is over!  Perhaps I will just have to go back and re-read them all...hurry up with the next book!",FALSE,2003,1468
"94",5,731189,TRUE,"Harry's back, but he's not having fun.  He's not even at Hogwarts before he's attacked, threatened with expulsion, has his reputation smeared by the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, and sent off to a secret society that provides no answers to his questions.  Hogwarts treats him no better; Hagrid isn't there, Dumbledore barely acknowledges him, and the new defense against the dark arts teacher refuses to provide practical lessons - then proceeds to terrorize the school with her harsh and restrictive rules.  Even his budding relationship with Cho Chang runs hot and cold.All this plus Snape's and Malfoy's usual treatment of him pushes him to the breaking point in the fifth book in the series, and Harry spends most of his time frustrated and angry at the forces that are ruining his life.  With his usual outlet of Quidditch denied him, his only refuge is leadership of his own secret - and rule-breaking - society of students dedicated to learning to fight the dark arts.Despite the costs, Harry is willing to put it on the line to fight for what he believes in - even if it means a direct confrontation between himself and his friends against Lord Voldermort and his Death Eaters.  In the end, victory is his, but this time the price might be higher than Harry is willing to pay...Major secrets regarding the past history between Voldemort and Harry are revealed, as well as a few about the Dursleys.  Harry learns many harsh truths in this episode, including the fact that many people he looked up to weren't as perfect as he thought, and others he despises may have some right on their side.

"98",5,731192,TRUE,"When I got the Harry Potter book, my expectations for it were fairly high, considering the length of time it took Mrs. Rowling to write it. I was also ready to criticize, being a bit frustrated having waiting this long. But once I started the book, I could not stop.All 870 pages were thrilling, humorous and suspensful. The charaters develop so much in the fifth installment to the Harry Potter series. Since Harry's fourth year in Hogwarts, the Ministry refuses to believe that Harry's story about Voldemort arising is true, and try to convince the rest of the Magic population that it isn't true either.Harry and Dumbledore try all they can to pursuade people that the Ministry is wrong, and that they have to be prepared for You-Know-Who. But Professor Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher sent by the Ministry, is not letting them, by teaching in a different way. But Professor Umbridge is not only disliked by the students for her odd way in teaching, but by the other professors as well.As much as everyone would like to deny the fact that Voldemort is returning, there is still an orginization called The Order of the Phoenix which tries to get as much information as possible on Voldemort as possible, and try their best to look after Harry. But Harry's scar seems to be hurting more often, and this tiem Harry can feel what Voldemort himself is feeling.In this fun and suspensful book, you can go through the same journey as Harry and his friends go through, and realize different truths that Dumbledore will finally explain to Harry, that has lingered in his mind for the bast 15 years.",FALSE,2003,1471
"100",5,731192,TRUE,"(No more spoilers lie herein than you'd find on the jacket of the book.)J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series falls somewhere between pre-adolescent fantasy and timeless literature; its protagonist is a boy who grows before our eyes, and although Rowling's universe was clearly assembled before she began her first book, her skill as a writer grows along with Harry.My childhood was filled with Madeleine L'Engle, Susan Cooper, C.S. Lewis, and J.R.R. Tolkien.  Rowling is perhaps this generation's only provider of truly transcendent literature for youngsters, keeping her subject interesting to the young reader without compromising quality or engaging in histrionics.  (The Lemony Snicket series, which is perhaps funnier to adults than to children, is still not great literature - more like Edward Gorey in typeset instead of ink.)With ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", Rowling spreads her wings and also allows Harry to branch out into humanity with all its many facets.  If the Harry Potter of the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" was too plucky in the face of adversity for you, you'll relate much more to the 15-year-old, who now faces all of the crippling insecurities and doubt that make life as a teenager both harrowing and educational.  His gut-wrenching triumph at the close of ""Goblet of Fire"" is brought into sharp, non-fantasy relief by the opening of ""Order of the Phoenix"".  The Harry Potter phenomenon in our world is at its nadir; in Harry's world, he has returned to the role of misfit and outcast that he thought he'd left behind when he began his life at Hogwart's.Rowling's writing is more confident, as though the voice of the 15 year old boy is the one she knows best.  She describes in succinct phrases the heady mood swings of adolescence, showing neither pity nor disdain to the subject.  The story here is much more dark; the Triwizard Tournament of ""Goblet of Fire"" was still a school contest, but the outside world encroaches on Hogwart's in this tale and the tone from start to finish is darker for it.The Harry in this story faces many of the things a headstrong boy his age would in the real world - challenges of popularity, struggling in school, minor run-ins with law enforcement and tests of strength in his friendships.""Order of the Phoenix"" trusts its young readers to be able to use all of the Harry history they know to follow him through the book's events, and emerge unscathed even if a few sleepless nights between cliffhanger chapters occur on the way to the end.  The suspense and tension in this novel are genuine from the first chapter onward, unlike Goblet of Fire, which always felt safe until its very end.Although my personal opinion is that children will find far worse on prime time television, some parents may feel the minor language and descriptions of violence in the book are too much for younger kids.  (In truth, I often chuckled at the very rare and well-placed minor cursing - which captured the unsteady voice of a teenager who is only beginning to test his right to speak those words aloud.)We need not fear that the Harry Potter series will outgrow its original core reading audience, since it's growing up with them apace.  I also strongly recommend ""Order of the Phoenix"" to adults who found the first Harry Potter books too childish for their liking.",FALSE,2003,1471
"101",5,731189,TRUE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a marvelous edition to J.K. Rowling's library, and well worth the long, long wait and the number of pages.  Although the book is the darkest novel yet in the Harry Potter saga, it reads like one of the earlier editions, happy and light with plenty of humor thrown in compensate for the overall dark tone of the novel.  The plot is complex and involved, but never difficult as Rowling takes time and trouble to make certain everyone understands the mystery before moving to the next part.Many characters in this book become more well-rounded, and their actions are better justified.  Professor McGonagall becomes a much more likable character, and we get more insight into the reason behind Professor Snape's hatred of Harry.  We also see Harry's love life blossom somewhat as he ages, and he goes through typical teenage strife with his friends, Ron and Hermione.The ending is an exciting, heart-in-your-throat adventure that is sure to delight Harry Potter fans old and new.  My only advice for reading this book:  Don't make this your first Potter foray.  Read the other books first.  Rowling doesn't explain every detail from the first ones; she just assumes you've read them and doesn't bog you down with details you already remember (if you've read the first four).Basically, this is a very exciting book that well lives up to the Harry Potter saga and is sure to delight the many legions of fans who have waiting with bated breath for the newest edition.",FALSE,2003,1468
"106",5,731925,TRUE,"What can I say except WOW!  Jo Rowling has to be one of the truly great writers of our time.  Book 5 introduces new characters who are incredibly well-developed.  Dolores Umbridge is one of the most hateful characters I have ever encountered, but her introduction into the series makes it so fasinating that it is nearly impossible to put this book down for even a minute.  I am reading it now for the third time and, as with all of the HP series, JKR has hidden information that is key to the entire storyline in nooks and crannies that can only be discovered by reading and rereading.  The main trio, Harry, Ron and Hermione are developing into very interesting teens.  I love the Weasley twins and there is a section devoted to them that is priceless!  Luna Lovegood is also a most interesting character and I was happy to see that her character was fleshed out in this book.  The spells are getting more interesting and the drama surrounding Lord Voldemort is getting more intense now that he has returned to his body.  Neville's character has developed too and that is great!  After my first read, I was quite disturbed with the events in Order of the Phoenix, but after the second read, I was enraptured just as I was with the previous 4 books.  If you haven't already, read this book and then read it again.  It just keeps getting better and better!!  Another Winner from JK Rowling!",FALSE,2005,2204
"108",5,731191,TRUE,"I was afraid that a book this long would be repetative and lacking substance. I was wrong. The book moves along with each page and trying to trim any of the content would have been hard. The book starts out as usual at the Dursleys house, and then moves on to Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. Unlike past books, Harry is now a full blown teenager with gripes and attitude (just like my own 15 year old). He's not the big hero on campus this year-he's the laughing stock. The wizard's local paper has dubbed him a ""nutter"" and even his bunkmates are unsure of whether to believe his story about Voldemort. This installment has another evil character for Harry and his friends to contend with each day-Prof. Umbridge. This character is the essence of all that is evil in government intervention in people lives-especially education. As an special needs educator, I saw parallels to how our own government tries to impose its idea of a perfect education. This new twist in bringing in social controversy into her fantasy world gives the book a whole new dimension. One that is full-bodied and rich. J.K. Rowling has grown from the other books along with Harry and is allowing her readers the chance to be transported into the world of fantasy, but with the tip of the broomstick touching into the real world so that we can all find ourselves in the story.Now that summer is here and the kids are out of school.

While I thought number 4 was truly great, this one actually surpasses it.  Now a teenager with the normal teenage angst, Harry must also deal with the horrors of only two months ago, with nightmares and no one in his Muggle world in whom he can confide.  Even Professor Dumbledore is distant, while Ron and Hermione write infuriatingly vague letters. When excitement suddenly enters his Muggle world, he realizes again that he's still a target of those who wish him ill.  At long last, he's back at school, only to find a particularly loathsome new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: Dolores Umbridge, who looks like a toad and plainly despises Harry and anyone connected to him. Life is more and more complicated, as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors haunt Harry, teachers come under professional attack, and the wizard world is poised to tear itself apart from within.Simply reading the chapter titles was exciting.  One title caused me to make an assumption about the major character slated to die.  Let's just say I was way off the mark.  Thank goodness.Buy this book!  Collect the whole set.

"110",4,731192,TRUE,"As you move through the Harry Potter series the reading level gets progressively more difficult - so does the intensity and darkness of the books. The relative innocence of the first book may fool parents into thinking the whole series is appropriate for young readers. A word of caution - in my opinion it isn't.I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the books in the series but I have to say I came away from this latest book with mixed emotions. The innocence is definitely gone! This book is full of anger. Harry Potter's anger and frustration made him seem almost like a stranger at times. I really got caught up in his anger at the injustice, both real and perceived, that he and others suffer in the book. I'm concerned how it may affect younger readers.Plus, at 15, Harry is growing up and facing adult situations and emotions. As a mother I found myself wanting to sit down with him to counsel and comfort him as a parent would. The kid in me wished I could be his friend and fly off on a thestral - to fight at his side!So - do I recommend this book? Yes, I liked the book and didn't want to put it down as is evidenced by me reading all 870 pages in 3 days! But I urge some caution - I think this book is more suited to mature audiences. I won't be reading this one to my 7 year old granddaughter for a few years. Can't wait to see this one in the theatre though! Should have some spectacular scenes!Am I eager for the next installment?

"111",5,731191,TRUE,"I've waited a long time for this book and I wasn't disapponted. There are a lot of diffrent themes/subplots brought up in this book , so sometimes it feels like you're reading a bunch of short stories all at once. However the author keeps them nicely arranged (for the most part) and weaves it into one neat (and exciting) book.This book is all about revalations. Revelations into some of the character's pasts and personalities, revalations about the wizarding society as a whole, as well as revalations regarding some of the secrets.  Some of these you could see coming from miles away, but I'll bet that everyone who has been following these books will come away with at least one surprise. To say more would make this a spoiler review, which I don't want to do.A major theme of this book is also the elitism among the wizards and the borderline contempt/hatred they feel towards non wizards. I'm not just referring to muggles, but to ALL of the creatures encountered. Rowling goes heavily into this theme by describing some of the ill effects to the other groups that have been looked down on, especially the anger and contempt returned by those groups onto the people that mistreat them. I challenge any reader not to think about racism while they are reading those passages.Also very well done is Harry's teen angst. It's been half a lifetime ago since I was that age, but Rowling really brought back memories of the confusion with the opposite sex and the annoyance/anger you get when well meaning adults keep information from you or mollycoddling you. All of the secrecy leads to a tragic conclusion that will resonate strongly with young people. There is a healthy bit of ""challenge authority"" here (more so than the last books) which may have some adults coughing nervously (hem, hem), but will delight many youngsters.In short, its a more ambitious, more sophisticated read than the last one, but its still amazing and entertaining fun. Can't wait for book 6.",FALSE,2003,1470
"113",5,731190,TRUE,"Knowing what a slow reader I am, I took off work to read ""The Order of the Phoenix"" on my pre-set strick schedule which involved 2 hour naps and 20 minute dinner breaks.  Thanks to the momentum of this amazing tale, however, my schedule went by the wayside before Saturday was over, and I finished the book in half the time I had planned for (and slept there after).  This was the best book of the series.  After 3 long years, we finally get to see 15 year old Harry (with a 15 year olds hormones) deal with the return of Voldemort to full power, disappointment and frustration when his friends are given more responsibilities than him, and the guilt and anxiety of his responsibility to his real family, Sirius Black and the Weasleys.It is the worst book in the series for the emotionally unstable, like myself.  The death of a major player in this book, and the very dark themes of the dark magic and the temptations of power are devastating.  The death, in particular, is a hard blow for those of us who have trouble keeping in mind that these characters are fictional and that it is indeed, just a book.  I had to put it down several times and remind myself of that during particularly anxious or morose sections.There is nothing that Rowling could do to this book to make it bad.  After 4 books, Harry and his friends do feel like family, and it's not really a question of how good anymore, but how intense (and how long will we have to wait for the next installment).  However, this book really was an exceptional story.  Rowling has really captured the mind of a 15 year old boy with his insecurities, frustrations, and hormones.  Harry is more real than ever before and his judgement is more human.  He makes mistakes that are terribly costly and even though he learns his lessons, life doesn't just go back to being a beautiful magical wonderland.  He has to live with his mistakes from now on.  Those around him are more human too.  Even Dumbledore is shown to have faults that are very human and help lead to the disasters that are faced in this story, and no doubt in the future.

Surely people raced to finish to book and post spoilers everywhere.  I cannot imagine where people are waiting to read a review to make a decision on whether to pick up this book.  But if so, know this - this book was impossible to put down.  Harry is growing up, these characters are maturing and changing with the events they are enduring.  It was again a fascinating read, but the character development was beyond expectation.I started reading the Harry Potter books when Chamber of Secrets came out.  I am sure I don't have a new story - friends laughed, it's a kids' story, slowly they got on the band wagon, indeed most of the world is on the band wagon, we all laugh and cry with Harry, religious zealots say the books should be burned, Hollywood makes millions, Lego makes little toys, blah blah blah.But if somewhere someone is jaded, disillusioned, tired of the hype, turned away from the books because they believe they are above them, want to be different, or above the trends and ""fads"" of normalcy - you're a twit.  This book once again shows Ms. Rowling is a very much talented writer with a very good idea of where she is taking this story.  I thought when I finished the book I would be anxious for the sixth book.  Instead, I am anxious for the sixth and seventh.  I am anxious to see where it all is going now.

Therefore, I was a little concerned about how good book 5 would be.  I shouldn't have worried. I, personally, found the 5th installment of Harry Potter to be far more interesting, engaging, and intense than book 4.  Yes, Harry is more self-involved than before, and comes off as a petulant, grumpy teen at times...but I chalk that up to teenage angst and think it only serves to make him seem more ""realistic.""  Up to now Harry has basically been a pretty happy kid, despite all the bad things in his life, but in this book we see him struggle with deeper and more negative emotions.  I, for one, appreciated seeing this more ""human"" side of Harry.  Also, I must compliment Ms. Rawlings on her choice of character names in this book.  The house elf ""Kreacher"" (I assume meaning creature), and especially Professor ""Umbridge"" (who literally takes umbrage at everything Harry says or does).  Clever play on words!

It's clear why this book took three years to write. There's so much going on, so much meat... snippets of humor dovetailing into pure terror, high fantasy mixed with in-depth social structure, characters rising to become heroes and others falling to darkness or ignorance.

"117",5,731190,TRUE,"I love Harry Potter, and Rowling's latest episode has a lot of the same elements many of us have grown to love-the magic, wit and adventure-that permeated the first four books.  But she takes a big turn in Book Five.  She told us she would.  We were warned.OtP starts off shortly after Book Four leaves off. (Don't worry, no spoilers here!) The action strikes right at the beginning and the twists and turns kept my stomach churning until the end.  No long, slow buildup like the other books.  She wrote Book Five for the big screen, the chases and the special effects that we know are coming are still whizzing in my head.  And at 870 pages, it still seems to have gone all too fast.  But unlike the other books, everything goes nightmarishly wrong.Harry feels it, as does Hermione, Ron, and nearly everyone else.  The book is also full of adolescent angst and sarcasm.  Harry and friends also start to question authority and each other.  That makes them-to non-adolescents at least-a bit less enjoyable to be around.  They snap at each other (and their elders) like never before, and we begin to wonder whether the sun will come out and change everyone's mood.It does, in little doses.  Fred and George Weasley are up to their old pranks like never before.  This is their finest hour.  They turn their jokes into a kind of heroism in one of the most memorable scenes in the series.We also get to see a lot more of other characters that played bit parts before, like Ginny and Neville.  They help round out the universe along with a few more additions.  Rowling not only expands her magical universe geographically-we do see a lot of a magical place we haven't seen before--but also through characters, who are either new or develop more.With hormones raging in their veins, there is more romance than Book Four.  The who-is-seeing-who game Potter fans have been playing for three years since GoF is played out in the story as well.  Our friends have turned fifteen, and the romance roulette has begun.  While a lot occurs off-camera, Rowling will leave a lot of hearts pounding, albeit in (thankfully) PG fashion.Rowling also litters her story with some verbal zingers, usually in the mouth of Hermione aimed straight at Ron. There is not a lot of them, but they are well worth the wait. Just one more reason to love them and Rowling.The characters have grown and Rowling writes as if her audience has as well.  Not only is the book longer, but the book's narration has matured as well.  It still reads like a conversation, but little ones are going to have more trouble keeping up.  With more mature themes, they are less likely to be able to relate anyway.  This is a big departure from the first four books.The most important change is that now that Harry is getting older, he learns that knowing the magical world in an adult way is a heavy burden.  A constant theme in the book is that Harry wants to know what is going on.  But the deeper secrets he learns aren't easy.  And while the adults around him still try to protect him, he becomes painfully aware of how limited their power is.  As he grows more powerful, he also learns how vulnerable he is and those who around him are.  He faces death once again.  Its more painful now because its not just a memory from long ago, but its someone he knows and loves...and feels responsible for.Order of the Phoenix is darker and more powerful than any of the other four books.  But the adventure is more emotionally draining and less emotionally satisfying as well. (That might not be all fair, since I zoomed through the book, we'll see).  Potter fans used to fairly happy endings might not like the bittersweet conclusion.  But OtP does end with an action-packed whollop.  Rowling ties up all the ends by the last page, but OtP leaves us with a sense of looming danger.Despite the gloom it is still a world we love, and when we've left it we miss Harry, Ron and Hermione.

The first two chapters are, in my opinion, the best two that JK Rowling has ever written. From there things slow a little bit but my interest did not waiver one time.We find out much more about the past of Sirius, Snape and Harry's own father James than we had done. Perhaps most importantly we find out Trelawney's first prediction and why Dumbledore has kept Harry in the dark up till now.Many questions are answered in this book but many are left open and, as it ends we wonder, now that the wizarding world is more united, what is the Dark Lord going to do about it? Will Harry fulfill his destiny or will Voldemort overcome him?And, on a lighter side, will Fred & George become the big kingpins on Diagon Alley, is Hermione wearing her Christmas present from Ron and what were there OWL results!On a practical note, those who do not have much experience of English slang might want to keep a British dictionary handy with this one - the book seems less ""translated"" than the others and much better for it.Finally, the wait was long but oh so worth it!",FALSE,2003,1469

She really does seem the embodiment of institutionalized evil, and her interactions with Harry and her stay at Hogwarts made me eager to turn the pages, wondering how the author would resolve her unwelcome stay at Hogwarts.I found the book's conclusion once again very exciting, surprising, and revealing.My only complaint might be the book's length. Longer does not necessarily mean better. Quite often I felt that the author's prolonged descriptions of things like the evolution of a character's demeanor during a verbal exchange did less for enhancing the story than it did in unnecessarily slowing down the book's tempo. This book likely has more words than Melville's ""Moby Dick"", yet alot less substance. Writer's who are encouraged to be more descriptive in their narrative ought to take that advice with a grain of salt.

"120",5,731181,TRUE,"I think that many people were disappointed by this installment of the Harry Potter series because J.K. Rowling tried to do something original here: make her characters REAL.  Sure, Harry has been a beloved character in the past four books, but that is exactly why he has hit this wall in his life.  Just remember, those of you that complain about book 5's ""darkness"" and Harry's ""whinyness"" or ""failures"" that this is exactly what Harry needs to become a better person, and eventually defeat V.This was a fantastic book, simply because it shows that Rowling has the ability not only to make her characters three dimensional people but to hold them there, even as they live in a fictional, magical world.  She doesn't lose her touch one bit.  And remember also, Rowling started this series because she wanted to write this story, not because the rest of the world wanted her to.  She is simply continuing to stick by that.This book is trying to show the chldren that have grown up with Harry Potter that the real world has a lot of hardships in it. Harry may have handled it badly, and he may not be the bright, perky person everyone loves, but that is what makes him real.  His failures make him stronger, his mistakes make him wiser, and that is what Harry needed.On a personal note, I thought the book was really wonderful.  Harry always worried me in the past, because he had that Oliver Twist life story, and I was afraid that he would grow boring, always being the smartest and the favored, etc.  I really wondered how Rowling could keep it going through seven books.  To show him at his worst proves to me that Rowling is a worthy writer, because she doesn't buckle to media, and isn't afraid of taking a chance.  Remember, if your hero is always good, and your enemy is always bad, you have static characters, a static story, and basically, nothing worth reading.The next book is going to be even better.  I predict it will be a little bit warmer and a little bit brighter, because Harry's failures are leading him towards the light, and the end of the tunnel.  Bring it on!",FALSE,2003,1460

The darkness that runs through the story comes from several sources, some expected, some surprising; You-Know-Who and his followers, of course, but they are (unwittingly, one hopes) abetted by a wizard government that behaves in untrustworthy and Harry-hating fashion. Add to this the turmoil of Harry's turning 15 while living his life entirely on display, friends who turn against him, several loved ones put into mortal danger, mentors who let him down, and the truly poisonous persona of Dolores Umbridge, and you have a book that is less whimsical, more complex, and more deeply felt than most.Even in the darkness, however, humor still lurks... Fred and George Weasley are testing potential products for their joke shop, and even the most mild-mannered Hogwarts professors have funny little ways of meeting the challenges presented by Professor Umbridge.

Having read it, I think the books and the characters are simply growing up.  Things are not so black & white anymore.  Harry now has to deal with things in greyer terms.

In The Order of the Phoenix, Harry - as well as several of the students:  Ron, Neville, and Ginny - get to develop more as characters and are start to show signs of thinking more for themselves, rather than always reacting to everything (Hermione was 35 years old from the time we first ""met"" her so didn't have as much maturing to do as the rest).I realize that book only came out today, but the main question I was left asking as soon as I finished reading The Order of the Phoenix was ""When is Book 6 coming out?""

The fifth Harry Potter book is deeper, richer and more complex than its four predecessors, but it  also flows from and expands on the Potter history in an entirely natural way, growing as Harry and his friends grow in knowledge and experience, as Lord Voldemort's menace grows, and as author J. K. Rowling slowly unfolds the mysteries surrounding Harry and the peril in the wizarding world.  Plot and pacing aside, however, the greatest strength of the book is its honest and unflinching portrayal of the feelings and motives of its characters, including the less than noble, but very human, feelings and motivations that make the denizens of the wizarding world seem recognizable and real.  More than ever before, you step into the shoes of the main characters and feel what they feel.  This is especially true of Harry, who's every emotion reverberates in your heart, and gets thoroughly under your skin.

For the last four books, the praise of Rowling's writing has always been followed by remarks about it being a light, sweet story about nothing that goes easy on the brain.  That is over now in a big way. Harry has grown up quite a bit over the summer.  He has the temper of a teenage boy; he no longer holds the (good) adults in his life in owe; he has developed a sense of his own abilities, but has not let that make him arrogant, as everyone expected.  He has grown. However, the things he goes through in The Order of the Phoenix FORCE him to grow up even more before you.  So much so, that I had to shut my eyes and walk away from the book to catch a few breaths, muttering to myself that this was enough, more than enough already... hoping it would stop, because how much can a 15-year-old boy be expected to carry on his shoulders?!  Neither is his world any longer circumscribed by the walls of Hogwarts.I was completely blown away by Rowling's inventiveness and her astounding ability to capture the spirits of the characters and their world in vivid, breathing color.

He is in a dark mood and events do not go his way. There are many wonderful things, however, my favorite being the revisiting of the Pensieve which Dumbledore loans to Snape and which permits Harry to have new insights into his father's character. James is Harry's hero and like all fathers, he has flaws that Harry needs to accept and forgive in order to mature. Harry's relationship with Cho is totally realistic and again allows Harry to grow and mature. Rowling is a genius as no other writer for many years. Like others, I reread all four previous books so that I could ""flow"" into book 5. I only wish I had read it slower, but I will read it again soon and savor it next time, as soon as my husband finishes.

Some will express their confusion with disappointment in the turn of events and perhaps even express their dislike of book 5, where still others will embrace this all with entusiasm.  However, a change there definitely is...and it is expected...at this juncture of Harry's adventures.There will be some who may see OOTP as less exciting or fantastic than the others, but Rowling really had no choice, if one is to look at the sequence of events from a logical standpoint.  From the TriWizard tournament to where Harry must go next, Rowling needed a catalyst of sorts.  Book Five is the catalyst. Potter is no longer a kid.  Rowling does the best job I can imagine to convey the turmoil and spacial changes a teen can feel, and I think, the side-effect of this, is that The Order of the Phoenix ""sounds"" different than the 4 before it.In all, a fantastic transition to ""the next phase.""

The toady and coniving Delores Umbridge makes for a maddening High Inquisitor as she grips Hogwarts in her dictatorial fist. Though new characters Tonks and Shacklebolt were fairly thin, Rowling dives deeper into numerous repeat character, esp.

So much happens in this story to test Harry's resolve.  A pack of dementors--Azkaban prison's guards--surround the school in an attempt to catch the murderer (Sirius Black).  These guard cause Harry a tremendous amount of grief.The storyline is fascinating. We get further background information on the wizarding world and, more importantly, on Harry. We are introduced to some new magic, new spells, and some new creatures.This is the book that will show you that this series has the power, the strength, and the story to carry it through seven books.If you decide you cannot commit to seven books or to worrying about some kid you don't know, consider reading just this one--even if it is out of order--before you quit the whole series.

However, in this book (as well as the 4th book), Harry comes face to face with deeper issues than merely learning magic from some truly eccentric characters.  Harry is forced to relive the past - a past that he has possibly blocked because of the pain involved or something he was just too young to remember: his parents' death and receiving his scar.In this book, Harry is forced to explore some details of his past - which is necessary for him to understand more about his life and even his future as a wizard.  Each of these trials are preparing him for something that only J.K. Rowlings knows.This book is considerably longer than the previous two books (but, definitely not as long as Book 4).  However, I believe that all readers will become quickly involved in this book, and they will wish it could be even longer!  Each time I have read this book, I have discovered little tidbits of information that I missed the time before.

I had even forgotten several (minor) characters names and had to look 'em up at some point.  Having mentioned that, I must say that this book was quite good, but pretty sinister.  I got tired of the bickering amongst Harry, Hermione and Ron, but really enjoyed the Fred and George Weasley exploits.  I really think I like those two characters best of all.  I plowed through this newest epic in one weekend because I got caught up in the narration.  There's an awful lot of ""stuff"" crammed into these pages, and the pace is often hectic.  Oddly enough, I was left somewhat detached and not affected by the one character's death, though I was surprised at which one did die.  I've since gone back to re-read parts, just for fun.  I just get the feeling that there was an awful lot of hype about this book and I wonder if it was all worth it.  I'm also not sure if this is the best book yet, but it was good reading, anyway.

It moves us swiftly from place to place and gives us a view of Harry's world that we've never had an opportunity to see before.  New creatures, new characters, and new villians fill the pages.  With rumors flying about a death in the book, and a confirmation from J.K., I was always worried about the slightest thing that happened to any one of the characters at any time.

After the dire events of book four, there is no way that our favorite young wizard could remain the understanding, most-always-level-headed young boy we readers have grown to love. This go round delves especially deep into the mind of Harry. He's at a delicate age, but his experiences over the past 4 1/2 year have left little else that could be described as such. Rowling pulls no punches and while I found it a bit unnerving to see the dark moods and dark thoughts of Harry, it made him all the more real for me and all the more anxious to see how he would handle the next ""big challenge"" facing him.I was also excited to learn more about my other favorites...Sirius, the Weasleys, Hermione...even the Dursleys (some surprises there for sure!)I know the phrase ""this is a darker book"" has been used for every book since The Sorcerer's Stone, but it is truly a phrase MOST applicable to this book.

Yes, I know he's had a lot happen to him in the past few years, but the constant anger and shouting isn't going to make his case.  Frankly, he acts like a typical know-it-all 15 year old. What happened the to sweet Harry we used to know and love?  Now he thinks he knows better than anyone else, no one else could POSSIBLY know how he feels, and, as usual, he totally ignores the sensible things he could do, like talk to Dumbledore about his problems, in favor of acting like a hero.  If he didn't want the constant attention, there are avenues he could take.  He's made the same mistakes time and again, he should learn from them.  Tell other people when something's wrong!The beginning drags a bit.

Throughout it, you are thrust into the story, which moves at a fast pace, and keeps you surprised as you struggle to understand what is happening to Harry, the Ministry of Magic, and Lord Voldemort himself. You wonder why Harry seems so angry all the time, and why the Ministry is working against Dumbledore, Harry, and the Order of the Phoenix. You get caught up, and you aren't dissapointed at the end either. It fits the book so well, I don't think anyone could have come up with a better one. (I cannot tell you the ending, of course)The only problems are the characters. They seem a little out of place this time. I find it hard to believe that Dumbledore would hex not only Fudge, but three Aurors. And I find it harder to belive that even the Ministry would allow Umbridge the power she had.

It follows the typical format, starting out at the Dursley's home, a year at Hogwarts and then ending in a battle, with Dumbledore explaining everything unknown to Harry, though I felt this book reads differently than the previous ones.  It is much darker, the characters are angrier and experiencing emotion much more than before.  The danger and confusion, especially for Harry, is heightened, and it makes for an interesting read.  Longtime fans, especially the younger ones, may be put off by this, but those that are will most likely come to appreciate it.  I think Rowling, in order to make a believable adolescent protagonist, HAD to write the story this way.

My wife nearly disowned me because I spent the better part of two days chugging through this nearly 900-page book.J.K. Rowling once again has written another good addition to the ongoing series of Harry Potter.  My imagination and attention was kept alive throughout the entirety of this book.  However, I finished the book with an empty feeling having not been fully satisfied with its conclusion.J.K. Rowling intertwined far too many stories and sub plots to wrap up at the end of the school year.  Dolores Umbridge character was over the top and often too distracting to the overall direction this series has been focused on.  A number of times I wondered if Umbridge or Lord Voldemort was the bad guy.  The disruption caused by Umbridge at the school of Hogwarts over shadowed the overall things I've really liked about this series.  I felt J.K. Rowling never fully closed out the Umbridge story to a satisfactory level.  The ending of the book was like watching ""Home Alone Part 22"" where childish endings show a stupid person running and screams out of a building.  J.K. Rowling closed out a book long story about Umbridge in three paragraphs, verses the couple of chapters spent on Voldemort and the Death Eaters.I was disappointed that she never spent more time on the House competitions and Quidditch.  I didn't feel the characters at the school of Hogwarts had anything to work towards without the magic and a competition of sorts.  I felt the parts of this series I fell in love with was lost in this book.  Harry reminded me of a spoiled, angry boy who never really developed his character in this book.  J.K. Rowling weakened the bond between Harry, Ron and Hermione I felt in the other books and replaced it with frustration.  I felt Harry turned into a spoiled angry kid who yelled at his friends, teachers and authority figures.  Maybe she was writing about all 15-year-old boys and their frustrations, but if I wanted that I wouldn't have to go any further than my own home.Unlike the other books, I kind of missed the good feeling at the end.

It was good to see that it was not business as usual for the cast of characters. It was also a change to see Harry acting more like a normal teenager for once. As always the author is able to spin a rather outstanding tale and captivate the reader. Now having said all that I would like to touch on why this is not a 5 star review. I would have liked a bit more in terms of surprises or plot twists. The author tried that at the end but it kind of fell flat for me.

OoP moves the central plot forward, and develops some of the characters much more, while still giving a few tantalizing glimpses of the wizarding world.I had one complaint - Harry spends a great deal of the book whining and acting generally younger than he did in the previous books. Far from a young man, made an adult before his time, he doesn't even act like a conventional 15-16 year old. For those that have been following the series, this probably won't make a difference, but the series' success is built on the likability of Harry, the boy who didn't choose his fate.The book's ending is darker than the previous books - a trend that has continued, which probably won't disappoint those that have been following the series from the beginning. However, parents of young children may not want to buy them the entire series just yet - remember, those that were young when they read book one are now young adults, and have grown up with the books.

And while all of the sidebar adventures were interesting it kind of dragged in the middle.  The main plot elements of Harry's conflict with the Dark Lord was not advanced very far.  The scene near the end with the magical combat between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters went on too long.  I got the impression that she is writing that scene more as a movie script than for a novel.  On the positive side Rowling doesn't shy away from inclusion of dark aspects in her ""children's"" books.  One of Harry's friends dies (or does he?).  Characters are rarely all good or all bad.

"179",5,731189,TRUE,"The Order of the Phoenix is not for children under the age of 12--it is too nuanced with the psychological and emotional development of Harry.  Younger kids will enjoy the action, the occasional humor and the inevitable marvelous creatures, but much of the novel will be better understood by adolescents.  Also, a reader who is not thoroughly familiar with the first four books will probably lose interest in Phoenix.  It is full of references to the stories and characters that preceded.  That being said, this 64-year-old Harry Potter buff put aside every obligation and  has just read the volume cover to cover. (Today is June 22.) Couldn't put it down.  The first half is a bit slow-going and the reader needs to adjust to an irritable and depressed hero.  But there are shocking surprises nevertheless, beginning in Chapter 1.  The second half of the book contains one amazing piece of villainy after another.  Professor Umbridge is about the most nauseating of all Rowling's Nasties, including even Snape, and her perfidiousness touches most of the people we have come to know and love.  Will she get her come-uppance?The first two books were magical adventure stories.  The third began to explore emotions and relationships to a greater degree.  The fourth combined elements of the first three, but with an overtone of danger, evil and tragedy.  But the fifth book I thought was the best and most satisfying for the way it pulled together all the threads of the others.  Unlike the fourth, it answered a great many questions and left me feeling satisfied.  If there is another long wait until the sixth volume, and I expect there will be, at least I know that Harry and Company are on the way to a resolution. Now excuse me.

The series so far lives up to its original promise; it's a dizzying joyride  of fun, fantasy and escapism.  And as for the hopeless killjoys who claim  the books promote witchcraft and the occult: puh-leeze, how many children  turned into Satanists after reading ""Hansel and Gretel"" or  ""Snow White""?

"182",5,731191,TRUE,"I've read few series as intriguing as the Harry Potter series.  A year and a half ago I was sick and tired of hearing Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that without knowing what it was.  So I grudgingly went to the library to find out if the craziness had merit.  I picked up the first four books, checked them out, and opened the Sorcerer's Stone.....and was swept entirely away.  I quickly blew money I really did not have at the time on the whole series (but it was worth it!) and preordered this book, the fifth one, the Order of the Phoenix.Out of all of them, this one is the longest, the most intriguing, and has some amazing changes, in not only Harry but his friends and those around him.Harry is different in this one.  He's starting to grow older, and though it isn't directly said, let me just say his hormones, including his temper, is kicking in.  After four, and by the end, five, years of fighting Voldemort in one form or other, you can really tell it's starting to take it's toll on the Boy Who Lived.  A human can only handle so much, and the author J K Rowling realized this well.  We also see more of Snape and his history, as well as the death of a very beloved character.  Harry has gone from beloved celebrity to a sort of pirah with everyone thinking he's gone crazy--that Voldemort could not have returned!  He, Dumbledore, and others are facing a lot of trouble ahead because nobody believes them, except for those who know them best.This book contains many adventures, and it's hard to keep mum on it, but telling much more will give away too many hints.

"190",5,730496,TRUE,"Rowling's Prisoner of Azbakan is a wonderfully written book.  With the recent troubled world seeming to fallapart around me, I took the opportunity of reading it as ""light"" fiction, and found myself engrossed in thecharacters, the carefully woven plot and the imaginative setting.  I had already read the first two Harry Potterbooks and had found them charming enough, but this episode seems to be somewhat more developed thanthe previous two.  The various elements of the plot were almost as skillfully interwoven as those of a wellwritten murder mystery (the only other type of narrative prose I indulge in with regularity).Although a little predictable in some respects, this did not detract from the story.  Here as in the earlier books,the author has taken up some very grown up motives.  Among these are: the death of parents, the loss and/ordeath of pets, the occasional falling out of friends, the unexpected goodness of individuals thought to be ""evil,""the fact that what ""everyone"" believes about an individual may not be true, that it's important to give the otherguy a chance to fully explain his point of view, the fact that fairness and justice are not always in the cardseven for the ""good guys,"" the fact that some individuals can influence events according to their own agendabecause they have power and wealth, etc.For children learning to live in a grown up world, the book certainly gives small doses of reality orientationalong with its fantasy.  The hero, as usual, comes out on top of the central action, but he does not alwaysprove to be totally correct about his understanding of events, and everything doesn't work out entirely his way.Above all the book underscores the notion that it is best to make value judgments with caution, and whencontrary data come ones way to be willing to change opinions accordingly--something even adults aren'talways good at doing.Although many of the ""lessons"" in living could become platitudinous, in fact to a degree are so, on the wholethe parable is delivered without being saccharine enough to put off an adult reader or so condescending as toput off a younger reader.  Here as in the earlier books, Rowling has managed to capture a very broad audiencesuccessfully because she has many things to say to each reader.

During the summer this is possible.Key elements: Harry and his friends face a rift in the wizarding world because of his claim that a dark wizard has returned.  He faces resentment and censure.  At School he also faces new obstacles.  He is no longer the wonderkind of the first book.  The Dumbledore character is enchanting and mysterious as usual although the beginning of the book would have you believe that he is being unfair to Harry.

It's not quite the kind of rollicking adventure of the previous books and isn't something I would advise for kids younger than 10 unless they're very mature. Harry is turning into an adult and the pressures and sadness of his life are starting to show. In a way, it's about time our favorite wizard was less than his quiet self. I know I'd have a temper with even half he's been through.A lot more of a downbeat story, this book manages to be good even though the heroes are suffering. What's good; Harry's characterization, general writing and storytelling.What's bad; a more convoluted plot that's confusing even to me, an adult, sometimes and that Mrs. Umbridge.

"204",4,731197,TRUE,"I waited a long time for a book that took me all of four days to read, so now I am back to waiting again.  Feels sorta like S. King's Dark Tower series.  Plenty of folks will go on and on about the book's finer points and the books not so fine points.  I could do the same, but why bother?  If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will read this book.  If not, this is not the ideal starting point.The book is long, the book is good, the book is dark.  The feel good moments in this novel are scarcely there, if there at all.  I think that JK Rowling has stopped focusing on the younger folks with her writing and has realized that she can really strike a cord with the older crowd who have already been through what our young hero is experiencing.  If the book were a movie, it would be a definite PG-13 for all but the most mature kids who are reading out there.  That said, the fifteen year old angst that Rowling captures is quite powerful and moving.  Some characters develop quite nicely, while others move in somewhat unexpected directions(that is a good thing, people).My only real gripe is that the death of an important character was handled rather badly.  It didn't get the build up it deserved; however, it leaves room for much Harry development in the future.  I know some have complained about the length, but I hope the following two editions maintain the 800 page range.  Longer would be too much, but when waiting three years between publications, anything else is too little.",FALSE,2003,1476
"205",3,731188,TRUE,"I must confess to some disappointment here. No doubt this is due in part to the great expectations I had and the excitement I felt about getting my hands on Part V of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter saga. I have long admired Ms. Rowling's imagination, plotting and characters and consider myself a big fan. I found the first two books charming, but Prisoner of Azkaban raised the story to a whole new level for me. With its complex plot, stunning reversals and poignant ending, it remains my favorite Potter novel so far.  Book Four was overlong in my opinion, especially in the first ten chapters, but it improved for me in the rereading. One of Rowling's gifts has been how she times the introduction of a new character, setting or magical device to keep me enthralled even when the plot or subplot drags a bit. Examples in Goblet of Fire include characters like Rita Skeeter or the wonderful prefects' bathroom with its many bubbles and peeking mermaid. Nor are these additions extraneous. In Chamber of Secrets, Moaning Myrtle seems like a fun little extra to the Hogwarts family and then is revealed to have some important secrets.  So we come to Book Five, and I can't help but feel that, despite the addition of one amazing new character and a few interesting set pieces, this lengthy novel doesn't come together as well as I had hoped. There is much to like. Rowling does a great job portraying Harry as an angst-ridden teen. Unfortunately, this doesn't always make for exciting reading. As a high school teacher, I tend to find moody fifteen year olds less than compelling, and Harry was tiresome company much of the time. But I applaud the way Rowling has Harry grow and change from one book to another, affected both by the amazing adventures he has endured and by the very act of growing older. And yet, the plot is surprisingly devoid of surprise or of crucial incidents, and the climax is the most disappointing of any of the books.  Tons of new characters are introduced here, but it's surprising how few of them really register. Dolores Umbridge is a triumph of villainy. Rowling has created with each book a wonderful Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Dolores is no exception. I also liked Kreacher, the tragically stunted house elf. But most of the other new characters, both good and evil, appear too briefly to make much of an impression.  What is more disappointing is the way many of the old characters are used. While Snape and Neville finally get further developed and thus more interesting, and Hermione takes her place as clearly the smartest and most invaluable of the heroic triad (future Best Girl for sure!), Ron is given nothing of interest to do, and Hagrid and Dumbledore are seriously compromised. It's hard to describe how without giving things away, but suffice it to say that, for me, Hagrid's giant-like tendency to lovingly put his friends in terrible danger is growing tiresome for me. As for Dumbledore, the whole book hinges on his making a choice that makes absolutely no sense, given the wizard's wisdom and previous actions.  Having written all this, it seems almost ridiculous to complain. Rowling's saga is compelling, even when parts of it are less satisfying than others. I fully intend to reread Order of the Phoenix and expect to get more out of it the second time.

Alot of the time you will be wondering where Rowling is going with certain things, but its all explained in the end. I enjoyed the fact that Neville Longbottom is a much stronger character in this book, and not so much of a loser. Rowling goes into more detail in this book about things she just glossed over in the others, such as Harry's relationship with Cho Chang, What happened to Neville's parents at the hands of Lord Voldemort, why Professor Snape hates Harry so much, and Sirius Blacks life before he went to Askiban. As for the ""big secret"" of who dies. I am not going to spoil it. Let's just say that it wasn't who I expected, but it made sense in the story. This book won't disappoint.

"209",5,731195,TRUE,"Harry Potter, a common household name, has enriched the lives of children (and adults) worldwide. The 5th book in a series has the most Chapters, and is the longest ever. It revolves around 15-year old Harry whose fifth year at Hogwarts proved to be the most difficult ever. JK Rowling introduced several new characters like Nymphadora Tonks (a notable character in the Order of the Phoenix), Luna Lovegood (a Hogwart student in Harry's class who shared central roles in the book), Dolores Umbridge (a Ministry of Magic official who thinks she could bite more than she could chew at Hogwarts). JK Rowling elaborated more on the family history of Sirius Black, which helped because it provided a rational for her to justify Sirius fate in the end. Rowling also introduced a family member Hagrid did not know existed. Harry's love affair with Cho Chang was given some emphasis, but as hormones come and go, it also dissipated in the end. Most remarkable, is the Weasley's family, who despite encountering troubles here and there, again and again, still managed to project themselves as very happy and loving individuals. Professor Snape, despite Harry's distrust in him and being a rather dark character in the book, somehow saves the day unbeknowngst to Harry. Finally, Dumbledore is definitely someone who always ""saves"" the day. Several instances in the book where Dumbledore proved to be Harry's ally, and there were times that Harry thought of him as distant, unconcerned person. Nevertheless, there are exciting Chapters where Dumbledore showed that he's not only the greatest Wizard there is, but that he is also human, who makes mistakes like everybody else. This was evident at the very end of the book. To summarize, the book has 38 Chapters with 870 pages, and chockfull of thrills, juvenile fun, action and excitement. New characters were introduced, while old characters evolved and one in particular moved on. The book in fact is an introduction to the coming war (so called ""the second war""), where according to JK Rowling in her recent interview, may be the reason why we might not see Harry reach his adulthood.

The one thing this book makes clear is that another one is coming and is absolutely required--believe me, you'll want to read the next as soon as you've finished this one.

Harry is painted as emotional and moody with a lot of anger (not surprising given his history) and angst. Harry's fifth year is very difficult, by homework, upcoming OWL's (special final exams-Ordinary Wizarding Levels), and by political type confilct occurring between Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic. If you are not a child reader (as I am not) this is beyond time to get into this series. Harry is portrayed as a typical 15-year-old boy and yet as the shining hope that he was born to be. As for other fans, I didn't ""enjoy"" this book as well as the others because it is dark, but it is a necessary component, I feel, of telling a coming of age tale in a boy's life who has had a dark past and is prophecized to have a difficult future as well.",FALSE,2003,1473
"218",4,731190,TRUE,"I understand that this book has sold more copies more quickly than any book in history, and that Amazon took pre-orders for around $3 million for it.  Impressive.  The story itself is not quite that awe-inspiring, but that's good news; if Harry's latest adventure were that brilliant, I can practically guarantee that people wouldn't love it as much as they do.We begin where Harry's adventures always begin; he's safe and miserable at the home of his disgusting relations, longing for the Hogwarts School and anxious for news from his friends.  Well, he eventually gets both - no prizes for guessing that bit.  This time, significantly, getting back to school and to his friends provides no relief, for several reasons.  First, much of the wizarding world thinks he's either crazy or lying about his previous experiences.  Second, his adult allies give him little or no information about how much danger he is in, from where, or what they are doing about it.  And third, although it is not spelled out, he gets no relief because he's turning into a teenager.(He's been a technical teenager for a couple of years now, of course, but now he really starts to act like one.  Never mind bloodthirsty enemies, horrible relatives and a cowardly Ministry of Magic - becoming a teenager is serious.)You've heard all the rumors about what happens next, of course.  Suffice to say that Harry and his growing corps of buddies spend the next several hundred pages fighting the evil wizard Voldemort, the reactionary elements in the Ministry of Magic, the snobs and thugs in Slytherin House at school, and the usual gang of idiots.  Nothing new there.  So do you really need to worry that someone will tell you how it all turns out?  No, you don't - you already know how it all turns out, that's why you're reading the book in the first place.Well, that and a few other things, but let's be honest; anyone who reads any popular fantasy series, including Harry Potter, and expects daringly original plotting is a fool.  Ms. Rowling is neither a brilliant prose stylist nor a devastatingly original thinker.  What she is, more so with each volume in her series, is a teller of rattling good yarns that carry a deep but deftly handled understanding of a young person's psychology.Why, for instance, is ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" so dark in tone?  Because the life of a fifteen-year-old, wizard or not, can be a dark place at times.  Let me ask you this: If you, like Harry, were a teenage boy forced to spend weeks and weeks with people you loathed, after suffering dreadful losses at the hand of someone who hated your every cell and was still out and about, and after you had unequivocally shown several times how brave and skillful you were - how would you react if every adult in your life said ""Just sit tight, dear, you wouldn't understand anyway, you let us handle it""?  You'd be an angel of light, would you?I don't think so, buddy.  On the other hand, if you, like Harry, have a normal level of decency, you would not throw temper tantrums every five minutes, either.  You would behave as Harry does here - you would struggle against bitterness and frustration, you would try to be kind to your friends, and once in a while you would lose it and nail everyone in sight right between the eyes.All of this is right on target, as anyone knows who has raised an adolescent boy, had dealings with an adolescent boy, or been an adolescent boy.  What's more, Harry in this book must contend not only with a highly pressurized attempt to grow up, but also with the true unpolished memory of his father, the mysterious minds of girls, and his role as a leader - to say nothing of the ongoing threats to his life and sanity.  All of those, except the last (I wish), fall to the lot of every maturing teen.  People wonder why Ms. Rowling's books get thicker with every passing Hogwarts year?  Well, so does the life of an adolescent.I cannot agree with those who gasp with delight at every Harry Potter development or trumpet the series as the best of all time, hence I must give ""Order of the Phoenix"" four stars rather than five.  (I should add that, although I actually consider ""Goblet of Fire"" the best Potter story to date, it outdoes ""Order of the Phoenix"" by only a hair's breadth.)  On the other hand, I re-read the first volume not long ago, and as good a read as it was, it was pretty formulaic as compared with ""Phoenix"".  Like I said, Ms. Rowling improves fast, and her series has indeed developed into something that approaches the unique.  As a teacher, I would stop worrying about any young person who loves Harry Potter - such a youngster has a brain and a heart, very good news considering how popular these books have become.  And who knows - if I were 15 years old and reading this story for the first time, from the pen of a writer who really seemed to understand what I was going through, maybe I really would say it's the best series of all time.Benshlomo says, Fantasy - it isn't just for babies anymore.",FALSE,2003,1469

In this 5th year at Horgoward, unlike other previous years, Harry Potter is a 15 year-old teenager. Some of the readers may find it disturbing to find out what he is doing at the year of 15. The transition between a kid and a man sure is painful and J.K.Rowling sure know how to describe it. You will find Harry Potter has more temper than before. His anger is exploded so many times in some first chapters and as the result, he gets so many detentions that I do not bother to count. Also in the story, Professor Dumbledor is removed and another professor with a personality like that of a snake takes his place. And that lady sure knows how to make Harry's life difficult. There are some surprises like Ron becomes Griffindor's prefect and keeper and Ginny has a boyfriend. The end of the story is very sad: the only person that Harry considers as a father and a brother dies (I'm not going to tell you his name, it's better for you to find out by yourself). Harry defeats the Dark Lord (again, as usual) and this time with the help of all his best friends and the people from D.A.

During a recent weekly business program on CNN an analyst suggested that probably the book has become so hyped because of the marketing muscle of all the big corporations. To which a NY Times journalist responded that people are not buying Harry Potter because Warner Bros or Scholastic cooked it up in their marketing programs but it is because of Rowling's writing prowess.

Later in the book, the evil toadlike Professor Umbridge (""hem,hem"")  has Harry in Detention with a quill that requires no ink.

Despite all their talents and powers, the wizards are frightened; peace and harmony are hard to find when evil is disrupting every aspect of the Wizarding world.This books is wonderful.  Ms. Rowling's writing skills get better and better with each book.  She has given the characters a greater span of emotional responses as each one matures towards adulthood--grownup and child alike.I gave this book five stars but that really isn't enough to indicate how great this book is.

Supposedly he throws  these constant fits because he's now an adolescent. Well, so are Ron and Hermione, and they  don't spend all their time shrieking in upper case.  Yes, Harry has a tough life and he's persecuted and misunderstood. But the extreme personality change is bizarre. Harry has become not likable .  It seems this adolescent illness has affected only Harry and Cho Chang.  Cho now whines a lot and has fallen under the dreaded stuttering curse. We had been  warned that an important character was going to be killed off in this book, and I was as curious as anyone else. By the time it happened, I didn't  care. The ending felt rushed and anticlimactic.  Professor Grinning Toad Umbridge was too utterly awful to be entertaining. Snape is cruel and evil too, but he's complicated, mysterious and therefore interesting. Hagrid's reason for being absent was unbelievably hokey and didn't  fit  with the plot. Maybe it will be revelant at some point.  One of the most cringe-producing parts of the story involves a  character being injured, which causes a speech impediment that  drags on for several pages. The first couple of ""Stubefies!"" were mildly amusing.  After that it god weally stubid.  Despite all my complaints, I read the whole 800-plus pages. Parts of it are captivating.

Will Black kill Harry before he is captured or are things a tad more complex than that?Loved the fact that Mrs. Rowling uses real legends and myths, such as Radcaps of Scotland and Kappas from Japan, yet also adds her own ideas, logic and humor.

Throughtout the book (based on the other books) I sensed that one character would meet an untimely demise, but it was in fact a different character with whom all readers will likely find a stronger attachment to meet their end.  Rowling did an excellent job of evoking emotions at that moment and I had to re-read the entire chapter to get a feel for all of the events of the scene.  Overall there was some good plot and character develoment.  Much of the quality of the series has to do with character flaws of the  people in the book, especially harry, making the whole experience more easy to relate to, despite the fantasy setting.

It is really dark in the beginning and everyone was miserable and fighting.  We all knew it was going to be a dark book, but I think it was overdone.  With the next two supposed to get even darker, I can't help but wonder if Rowling is about to alienate her audience who don't want their children reading it.  Is there a PG-13 or R rating coming up for future movies? The ""Final battle"" is absolutely amazing.  I couldn't put it down for the last 150 pages or so.  Rowling out did herself with that.

The Order of the Phoenix, though much darker than previous books, is an excellent read.  It not only rewards fans of the previous books by making reference to previous materials, it also builds off subplots and ideas from previous books.  In fact, after reading the series you'll become intwined with every subplot wondering what twist or turn will come up next.

Rowling is SO real - the way she describes Harry's teenage inner thoughts and feelings is so intimate with the adolescent experience - just watching Harry struggle with that alone made the story interesting enough.  On top of that, I have always loved the fact that though the characters are witches and wizards, they succeed because of intelligence, practice, and bravery, not because something was just handed to them.  My only complaint about the book is that it hurt me deeply towards the end - I cannot say what that is because it is storyline related - you will know it when you see it (If it had to happen it should not have happened that way!).

The story is one of uncertainly and conflict, one that will probably not be resolved until the last book of the series arrives at it's final page. As with the stories preceding this one, the current piece of the larger conflict between Lord Voldemort and his followers and the rest of the wizarding world is carefully built until the confrontation at the climax of this installment of the story.

Perfectly delightful.  Lots of hidden nooks-and-crannies are revealed to the reader.As a final word, I thought the 'Hogwarts Queue' who were waiting for Harry at King's Cross Station [in the final chapter] was positively smashing.

It's simply a tough period in Harry's life, and he's at that age (15) where every boy is struggling to be a man.  He's grouchy, irritable, rash...  All the things most 15 year olds are.  There are certainly plenty of laughs, don't get me wrong, but it's just not a ""happy"" story.Everyone who has read the first 4 will certainly read this, so I'll spare you the, ""you should read this..."", but I will say, no matter your age or gender, if you've not read any of the Harry Potter books, get to it!!

Quite the opposite: I think this is her best so far. I do have to wonder about all the 4-, 6-, and 8-year-olds who'll try to read it, though. As you've probably heard already, this is an even darker story than Goblet of Fire. Nothing is completely black and white anymore; at various times, Harry has reason to doubt everything and everybody he'd once believed in, including Hogwarts and Dumbledore. He even discovers that his father, who has always been held up as a paragon of goodness and character, was perfectly capable of being an cruel, arrogant jerk at age 15. At the end, while Harry and his friends prove to be as brave and resourceful as always (including some you wouldn't have expected), it also turns out that Harry has screwed up big-time. Not entirely his fault--certain adults have screwed up, too--but all the same, the result is the unnecessary death of someone he cares about deeply. (This is the famous death that's been endlessly guessed about on the Internet, and no, I'm not going to tell you who it is.) Rowling doesn't sugar-coat this, or leave Harry an easy emotional out; the end is not a downer, exactly, but it is quite moving. In short, Harry has to shoulder burdens that no 15-year old should have to bear--even as he's also going through an all-too-recognizable phase of being a moody, misunderstood teenager. He's finally getting angry at the situtation he's been thrust into by fate (and Voldemort), and isn't above lashing out at the very people who are trying to help him.I don't want to make this sound heavier than it is. The story really MOVES; 870 pages doesn't seem long at all. And Rowling's sense of humor is still very much with us, even when tinged with poignancy. I highly recommend the so-hilarious-you'll-want-to-cry portrait of two barely aquainted 15-year-olds and their hopelessly inept first date. Oh yes, and Harry does get his first kiss.",FALSE,2003,1470

Rowling has increased the maturity level of the book (writing as well as content) to match the fact that Harry himself is growing up and having to deal more with the adult world outside of Hogwarts. Things are more serious and yet there's still a great sense of fun about the whole thing.Harry actually acts like an average 15 year old here, having the occasional bout of self-pity, mood swings and thinking about how life just isn't fair. Typical teenager and many reviewers found fault with that. But Harry should get to act like a teenager, he isn't perfect and we shouldn't expect that of him (too many people already do in his world).So much happens in this book, and even if it is wrapped up in the end -- and some long-overdue justice delivered to a certain Slytherin's father -- it's not as tidy as in the first few books, but nor is it as frightening as the last one. We're left knowing there's still much more to come but this time it's on a far more uplifting note.Like the rest of the Harry Potter books, you won't be able to put this one down and when you're finished with it you'll be anxious for more.",FALSE,2004,1758

Harry is experiencing angst all through this story, it is not easy being a teenager, let alone a teenager who is also a brilliant wizard.

"305",4,731190,TRUE,"I've been caught up in the wizarding world of Harry Potter since Year 1, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  I was as eager and awestruck as Harry in discovering the magical world of J. K. Rowling's imagination.  But as the wizarding world has become more mundane to Harry over the past 5 years the focus has gradually shifted away from the delights of discovery to Harry's growing desire to find his ultimate place within the world of wizards.  This change of focus has not made the Harry Potter series any less compelling for me.  I was just as caught up in Harry's travails during his 5th year as the adventures of his 1st.The main thrust this time is Harry's battle of wills with Professor Dolores Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who is malevolent even beyond Snape.  For where Snape has spent the book series trapped between his hatred of Harry and his need to protect him from Lord Voldemort, Professor Umbridge has a free hand to sadistically punish Harry and try to change the very essence of Hogwarts.  While I wasn't really satisfied with the resolution of the Harry vs. Umbridge battle, it's impossible to be too critical without knowing what might happen in books six and seven because, as all readers of Rowling know, characters have a way of reappearing in new ways.  I do feel that it occupied too much of the book however.  It gave a face to much of Harry's anger and resentment, but I didn't see any growth in Harry because of his encounters with Umbridge.One sub-plot where I would have preferred more development and depth, however, was in Harry's relationship with Cho Chang.  I think it would have held up as a larger part of the story.  Cho has never really been developed as a character.  She's just been an object of infatuation for Harry.  Unfortunately, we don't really learn anymore about who she is in Year 5, even in the face of a blossoming romance.  (And speaking as a former 15-year old boy, I think that Cho would have been on Harry's mind more than Rowling allows, even in the face of possible expulsion and death.)The biggest disappointment for me is that the Harry vs. Lord Voldemort plot that is driving the 7-book series plays a minor role in Year 5.  After the rebirth of Lord Voldemort and the return of the Death Eaters at the end of Year 4, I expected the battle between good and evil to be joined early in Year 5.  But if you expect that in Year 5, you've got about 35 chapters of filler to deal with.

I'm glad they didn't try to Americanize everything, but I did find it useful to find a British slang web site to use as a reference.  One word of caution, however, the first site I found was replete with vulgar slang.I've read the other Harry Potter books at least twice each and I'm sure that I'll read this one again.

I would have been very surprised not to have liked it, to be fair, but even so.One thing that I think Rowling has done well is to avoid making Harry into some sort of perfect Golden Boy. He makes mistakes. He has character flaws. In book 5 he has turned into quite the grumpy, moody adolescent, in fact. The ""bad guys"" are still almost uniformly evil, though, which I think could be softened a touch. They could be a bit more three dimensional.Regardless, the book was full of action and sub-plots and was a very fun read. We do learn a lot more about the backstory in this one, which is nice.

J. K. has done well to present him in a 'true to life' light.  (Reminds me of my own teen son.)  The book is everything that we had thought it would be.  Suspenseful, funny, dark, and a bit scarey too.  All our beloved characters are here, as well as a host of new ones.  Pieces of the puzzle slowly start to fit around Harry.  Makes the story very fun. We have always had 'one million' questions, and in this book, a few are finally answered!  Harry is growing up, and hopefully so - the reader as well.

It is a much darker book from the opening page to the closing page however this did not dissuade me from reading through it quickly. This is one of the first books in the series that does not really stand alone which I personally enjoyed. I have always found it bothersome when authors fill the first few chapters with nothing but back story that we've already read. This is one of the few books in the series that the action really does start in the opening chapter and continues throughout the book.This book is filled with information and surprises along with some things that did not surprise me at all. Voldemort is back in full power. The ministry of magic is doing everything in their power to keep from admitting to the possibility of his return. The Order of the Phoenix is out to stop his return and having to fight against the ministries paranoia the entire way. Professor Umbridge was a nice addition to the book. She truly was the character that you will despise completely and still keep reading just to find out how she's going to make you hate her even more. Harry is growing up quickly and has become very moody and on the verge of breaking under the pressure of everything he has gone through up to this point. Let's face it any kid who has nearly died that many times and faced as much as he has along with having someone that the entire world fears out to kill you and still the adults in the world will not tell you anything would be a bit moody as well.Over all I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

I dived right in and was not disappointed.  I admit that the number of pages was intimidating, however, like all the other Potter books, it just flowed.The story is definitely darker and more intimate than the previous novels.  Rowling lets us see very deeply into mind of Harry and how frustrating it can be as a famous wizard and a growing adolescent.  From Harry's extreme moods swings to his rambling rages that upset everyone around him, you can see how much Harry is growing up and the extreme pressure that is forming around him.The introduction of the New Dark Arts instructor definitely presents new problems and struggles for Harry as well as for the rest of the entire school.  I love the fact that Snape was placed in a different light and given the opportunity to show the rest of the world why he is how he is.  Rowling showed many levels of Snape and the rest of the adults in the story and made me want to get to know them better.I was disappointed in the ways that the anticipated death of a 'main character' was played out.  Rowling had many storylines that led up to a wide variety of possible deaths and then, at the end, she leaves ""the character"" with a death that does not seem plausible and is ambiguous.I would definitely recommend this novel to the avid Harry Potter fan.

Harry has grown up as a result of the events in Goblet of Fire and is angry, and quite obviously teenaged throughout this book. Rowling maintains the vivid description and sly sense of humor  that characterize the early books.One caveat, I would definitely reccommend that parents of younger childeren give this one a read through before allowing their children to read it. There is no swearing and nothing remotely sexual in content but the book itself is fairly dark. The ending contains a surprise which may be shocking and highly upsetting for some younger children. I would say that if you have children under 12 you might want to read this with them as a family effort.The book itself is absolutely wonderful.

He's frustrated by the lack of information given to him from his friends in the wizarding world and spends much of his time alone.  When he does return to Hogwarts, he has to deal with not only the disbelief of the Ministry of Magic (that Voldemort has risen again) but that of his peers as well.  Harry finds himself struggling with his anger about being kept in the dark about the Order of Phoenix and about the how terribly the year appears to be progressing at Hogwarts.  As the plot thickens the chapters near the end start to get very fast paced and you're hanging off the edge of your seat until it's finally over and you regret that this installment has come to an end.

Harry is a teenager now, filled to the brim with the hormones and angst common to all teenagers. Dealing with Lord Voldermort on top of all that makes him quite surly and unhappy for much of the book. I found myself not liking Harry much for long stretches of the story. That was the point, though, I think, to portray the true upheaval of puberty, the sturm and drang that is only natural to a boy of 15. It makes Harry not only a wizard and a hero, but a true-to-life portait of a misunderstood teenager.The novel is fast-paced and intense. You'll find the answers to lots of questions, and as many more questions are raised. I can't honestly recommend this book for younger readers, though. The dark undercurrent running through the story may be too much for them. I did like the book very much, though.

Now, five volumes later, I am a devoted reader. This, volume five, was no exception. The excellent character development and magical atmosphere is strong as ever. These books are the perfect escape from the concerns of the day.  Yet, Rowling has added a new element to this fifth book. Actually, it isn't new; it is more of a shift in emphasis. All of the previous books have contained valuable lessons about life, friendships, and the battle between light and darkness. This one, however, drives it home in a more mature manner. Many readers have called it ""dark."" I suppose that it is dark in the sense that it shows that good and noble institutions can be infiltrated and corrupted. A lot of people do not want to admit that possibility- especially to impressionable young readers. You see, characters like Cornelius Fudge and Professor Umbridge are all too common in the real world. They use once useful and beneficial organizations to gain their own selfish and twisted ends. It is the fortunate student who learns this lesson early while they are still in school and before they are blindsided by it in the outside world.Yet, in spite of this darkness, or maybe because of it, an important lesson is taught. The lesson is this- when the system is corrupt, you can resist. You can form an underground resistance and fight it, if you know in your heart of hearts that you are on the side of justice, right, and good. No wonder more than a few schools, churches, and parents have a problem with these books, and this book in particular....But perhaps far more frightening is the prospect that there may be something dark and unrecognized in yourself. It is this that young Harry must face and conquer. As these characters mature, so do the philosophical and moral issues that are covered. Personally, I cannot wait to get my hands on book six.

Even the most gifted ""amateur"" reader would be hard put to match this prodigious effort. The climactic fight near the end of the book, if anything, is easier to follow and far more exciting with Dale's pacing and delivery that a mere reading of the printed pages.Encouraged by this success I also listened to Dale's performance of the next installment (#6, Half Blood Prince) where his acting gifts make Harry's faults more vivid than the printed version (Potter is, by now in Dale's interpretation, definitely not your unblemished do-gooder) and intensify to an almost unbearable degree the final chapters of the book.

In Order of the Phoenix, few of the major characters are new [with the notable exception of the vile, pink-sweater-wearing-headmistress-wannabe Delores Umbridge] and she explores more deeply some of the old themes and characters. To my delight, some of the familiar characters emerge as unlikely heroes.  My heart soared as the defiant Fred and George Weasley flew away on their brooms to realize entrepreneurial success.  And Neville fighting Lord Voldemort alongside Harry -- who knew?  Hermione, of course, has always been my favorite.  Her quickly devised plan to introduce Umbridge to the Centaurs was brilliant!!  Many of themes in this novel left me feeling unsatisfied -- Harry's relationship with Cho Chang, being an example.  And really, he should appreciate by now that Snape is not his enemy.  In fact, Harry was not very likeable in this installment.  Self-absorbed, unnecessarily defiant, moody.  A byproduct of the teenage years, I suppose.

The fifth book in the series is no exception; in fact, it may well be the most rewarding for adult readers yet.  Emotionally and relationally, it is more intense than the earlier titles.  Part of this may be because Harry himself is growing up -- among other things he learns that even dearly loved and trusted grownups  will make mistakes and do wrong things, and that relationships with people of the opposite gender can be confusing and difficult.  While growing up, he begins to see the people around him in a new light. Because of this, the readers get to see other sides of the characters and get to know them better, especially Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, possibly the two most intriguing people involved in Harry's life.

Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is a great deal darker than its four predecessors.  Harry is angrier in book 5, and much of the story deals with his realization that the heroes that he has idealized in the past are, in fact, as human and fallible as he is.  Harry has grown into an adolescent, and Rowling shows an incredible ability to write accordingly.It is very difficult to compare this book with any of the previous Harry Potter books, as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix relies on its predecessors much more than the others have done.

Book number three was my favorite of the series. I thought that I had read the climax of the story about half way through the book so I was quite happy that the last half of the book would be so exciting!! There is a feeling of content that I get from reading the Harry Potter books. This series gives off a feeling of coziness, excitement, adventure, effection, and much much more. I have read each of the series so many times that i know every word of it practically. I would like to thank J.K Rowling for giving me the pleasure of reading such an awesome book! Or books should i say. I read quite alot and I have written some stories for fun of my own, but I must say that the Harry Potter books are the best of all of the stories that I have read.

It's long.  And it is very much an ending to the 4th book, but I'm afraid that it carried the weight of a book that was thrown together with bits off the cutting room floor.  I get the feeling from it that the author was pre-occupied in writing this story.  I'm a huge fan, I own all four previous years in Hardback and on CD and I love them. My favorite story remains ""Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban"".  Unfortunately I can't give details of what made the story drag for me, not without spoiling it for you.

The readers are growing up as Harry does, and Rowling has been able to accuratly judge what her readers can and can't handle, and while she may come close to the line, I do not think she has stepped over it.  I encourage the parents of younger readers, probably ages 12 and younger, to read the book with their children and help them with any of the parts that might be beyond their understanding or experiance, but I see no reason why anyone else would have any problems with the difficulty level of the book.This is a terrific and engrossing read, and I congratulate author J.K.

I was incredibly sad over the death of one of the characters, but I understand why that particular character was chosen.I did appreciate how JK Rowling has attempted to prove the characters are growing up, the jealousy, anger, frustration, and romance displayed in the book are fair representations of the emotions found in a teenagers life, just modified with witchcraft and wizardry. I did not appreciate Harry's many temper tantrums, but then again, it's not my book.It was also nice to see some new characters, as well as bringing Firenze back, he is such a cool centaur. oooo, that lady though, Professor Umbridge, she was a piece of work!!! i wouldn't like to have to serve a detention with that individual!I was very pleased with the book overall and I am very much looking forward to the next book in the series!!",FALSE,2003,1467

Too little plot was stretched out into an enormously long book and lacked the exciting twist and turns in plot of the previous four books. My advice to anyone buying the book (hopefully used since new is still too expensive), don't expect too much from this book because of the hype.Certain characters were back and good as ever, other new characters were interesting to follow. Harry experiences the pains of teenhood in a rather angsty, uninteresting and foul manner. There is a lot of filler story in this book and could have easliy been consensed into half its size.However, this is an important book in the series because many essential plot developments for the continuation of the series are presented. In short, buy it if you have already read the series and like it enough to sick it out through the rest of the two remaining books.

I was pleased to see a bit more character development in Harry, as mounting school and peer pressures make him both more worrisome and a bit snappish at times. He does seem a bit more introverted and questioning than in the earlier books in the series, an attitude assisted by an increasingly distant relationship with Dumbledore, clashes with Sirius, and much doubt over how to handle his blossoming relationship with Cho. This book spend less time on the Quiddich field and more time in Harry's head, making it slightly less of a fairy-tale romp into potions and spells, and more of a chronicle of a boy making his transition into adulthood.I was also happy to see that this book finally shed some light into exactly why Harry was targeted by Voldemort as an infant--that's been held out as a teaser for a while, and I was starting to wonder if we were going to have to wait for the last book in the series to find out. Of course, J.K. Rowling poses as many questions as she answers in this book, and we must all now wait for several months before we get more insight into exactly how much knowledge Aunt Petunia has of the magical world, and whether or not Harry's unthinkingly reflexive use of an ""unforgivable"" crucio curse gives us a hint into how the plot of book six might unfold.",FALSE,2003,1469

He does all the voices, male and female, young and old, and several different British accents.  He truly makes the books and their characters come alive.

One minor problem was that it's been so long since I've read any of the other books, I forgot most of the characters and events that happened in them.  But a pro is that during the end of the book, we find out more new information than all the other books combined (my opinion).  Another con is that most people know that J. K. Rowling already said that someone she thinks is a main character, dies.  This person IS a main character, and I could've picked about fifty other people who could've died and the book would've been beter.  Unlike some people, I like when the books are long.  When the books come out years apart, I don't want to be able to finish one in two days.  Also, for the people who really enjoy the Quiditch part of these books, there won't be mutch of that.  Like one person already said, reading this book does make you depressed sometimes.  Things just keep getting worse and worse.  But overall, I think this book is the best one in the series.

I was impressed.I've since read Book 2 and recently I read Book 3, Prisoner of Azkaban.  I would say that Azkaban is the best yet, although one can certainly argue how can one be more perfect than perfectipn?The superiority of the Azkaban lies in:1.  superior imagination - a magical bus that runs wildly but never hits things because the things ""jump"" away automatically; the boggart that assumes the form of one's worst fear; the map that shows every secret path and the location of everybody at any time.2.  watertight plot.  Even Ron's worthless rat that nobody would ever give a thought of carries unexpected weight in this story; every odd incident is explained naturally smoothly, and every explanation makes perfect sense.3.  well-arranged mysteries gradually introduced and explained at the proper time.4.  amazing character development.  Professor Lupin is such a lovable teacher, whereas the dementors can chill even the reader's bones, not only Harry's!As always, the book is so well-written (albeit simple) that the language alone makes it a joy to read.  I find it inconceivable that any one human being can write as perfect a book as this, but Rowling has written quite a few.  In comparison to the C.S. Lewis's Narnia series, for example, I think Harry Potter is  better in that the stories are more complex (yet perfectly lucid for even children).

Bravo for her her honesty as she lets young Potter ""grow up"" facing troubles typical of a 15 year old - teachers who are unfair, the challenges of figuring out the oppsite sex, alienation and frustration with adults, and impatience with friends.

From what I can discern, only three major issues are brought out, and character development is largely squashed by Harry's temper.  Ron and Hermione come no closer to realizing what they mean to each other, and though Harry teaches his talents to others, he doesn't display a large improvement himself.Though I was sad to see a main character die, their involvement in this book is minimal and Rowling shows no effort to make the reader more fond of the character during this book.  I think overall the book draws on the reader's emotional attachment in past books rather than developing a further empathy.I still love the Potter series, and anxiously await more novels, but Rowling seems to have held back in the Order of Phoenix.

The actions the characters take have definite consequences, although Rowling softens those consequences somewhat in the end (for me, this was the book's biggest downfall).Still, the story was so intense that all 800 pages were readable in a single night. Harry's emotions have been stirred up fantastically in this book and I ended up feeling many of them along with him. He is now prone to righteous anger and even violent fits of rage, which cause me to wonder if he will not become vulnerable to darkness in upcoming books.The tale of Harry Potter is becoming truly epic.

Fed up with being talked about his back and being accused as a liar, Harry spends a lot of this book being angry and lonely and losing his temper. He flies off the handle seemingly every other page in the first half of the book. It seems he has an uncontrollable temper, a lot of suppressed rage and bottled-up anger. He seems to have lost all sense of self-preservation and he seems intent on going around bad-tempered all the time making enemies and getting in trouble on a regular basis. He hates being whispered about, but he keeps giving people reasons to whisper. I got tired of reading about his constant unhappiness and his continual temper tantrums. It was overkill.This book was a bit too long. It's not until 200 pages into the book that the students even arrive at Hogwarts. A lot of that first 200 pages is devoted to the description of cleaning the old Black house. One good part about the pre-Hogwarts story was that it was interesting to finally read about the offices of the Ministry of Magic. But on the whole, Rowling starts trying to create too many subplots in this book. And as usual, everything tries to get explained all in the last 20 pages, but there were a lot of questions left unanswered.After five books, we find FINALLY find out at the end of this book the reasons why Harry is forced to spend his summers with the Dursley's. However, the explanation contradicts the fact that Harry had to be followed, guarded and protected during the first part of the summer, while he was still at the Dursley's. There were lots of other unanswered questions as well. What were the parchments that Bill and Mr. Weasley were looking at after the first Order of the Phoenix meeting that took place upon Harry's arrival? Why was the time and location of the hearing changed at the last minute and who changed it? Why did they have a full trial in the old courtroom? Why did Fudge seem flustered that Dumbledore managed to show up at the trial? What exactly was Umbridge's motivation for wreaking such havoc at Hogwarts? Why was Umbridge going to allow the Slytherin team to reform but not the Gryffindor team? What were the brains in the tank all about, and all the other strange stuff in the Department of Mysteries? What was with the veiled archway? Luna's ""explanation"" didn't really explain anything about what was behind that veil. And where did the person who fell through that veil end up going?But the book wasn't all bad, not by any means. Despite the problems I had with it, I still found it more enjoyable than not. The focus of the story is Dumbledore's and Harry's efforts to convince the wizarding community that Harry is telling the truth about the return of Voldemort. There are new revelations about Harry's past and some ominous warnings about his future. Despite the overall gloomy mood of the novel, there are some fun parts. The awkward relations between Cho and Harry are highly entertaining. I wish there had been more of that. Ron's reaction to Ginny having a boyfriend is quite amusing. There some interesting new characters in this book. Dolores Umbridge is the Ministry of Magic employee who takes over the Defense of the Dark Arts position and makes enemies out of nearly everyone she meets. She is convincingly hateful, sickeningly sweet and maddeningly irritating. An awful woman. My favorite new character is Tonks, who is only seen briefly at the beginning and end of the book, but who is hilarious nonetheless.I liked this book. It's not as good as the first four and there are too many ominous and dark parts for my taste, but I still enjoyed reading it. I do miss the lighthearted fun of learning about the magical world, though.

Everything seems so black and white in these books, but the author is starting to play too much upon this type of theme (good versus evil) instead of what made the series interesting in the first place (anticipation, the unknown, reasoning and solving skills, characters who felt that they were real people in real relationships - not unrealistic ones, as well as all the nifty creative ideas that makes this story much more unique than that of other series).  Many of us can identify with some of these characters.  Hagrid - the big caring brother for example (I sort of miss him, wished he was in here more).  Peeves, the jokester.  In these recent books, however, the character interactions are becoming too simple and too linear (and in my opinion, too unrealistic).  Some of these characters, unlike the previous book, also get on your nerves sometimes (Harry with his temper tantrums, Hermione with her know-it-all I'm always right attitude, Ms Weasley the control freak).  I wouldn't have minded this, however, if the relationships were real.  But people aren't reacting to them in a realistic manner.Also Hogwarts felt like a fun place to be in some of the previous books, but in this book it felt like you were going to well -school.

I am glad that she is not being stereo-typed as a ""weaker little sister"" needing protection. I also like the obvious (this is a kid's story at its core) message about unity and banding together across school ""houses.""

The books needed the sense of how seriously dangerous these ""adventures"" are---and there was not much a future for real contribution from this character unless other circumstances were to be changed around alot.It was disturbing going through the book in one sense because Harry really has NO HAPPINESS in this book.  While less scary, it borders on something more appropriately labeled ""dark""--I kept wanting a bit more comic relief, but artistically it was probably the right choice to have less humor here.  Still, it's a page turner to the end, and I will be waiting for the chance to sign up for my next installment.",FALSE,2003,1471
"663",5,731194,TRUE,"True to her hints, Rowling has written a much darker novel this time.  The Order of the Phoenix signals a change in Harry and his life.  He is older, but not necessarily wiser, and is a very typical teenager.  Rather than write about a teen who is bypassed by puberty and all of the attendant woes, Rowling has chosen to confront girls, fame, anger, and the fact that Harry is starting to realize much more fully who he is and what he has to confront.  While the overall tone of the book is dark, there are some very funny moments and Rowling is at the top of her form.  And, Harry is not the only one who grows.  More than the previous four books, this one works with an ensemble cast.  In addition, Harry's actions have much more far-reaching consequences.

Snape was the only one who gave it right back to him consistently. And although his teachers - and sheesh Hogwarts had more than its fair share of horrible ones - were far from likeable either, I found myself occasionally siding with them (though not Professor Umbridge).But while he was over the top, it seemed like Hermione has managed to morph into a serene, wise-beyond-her-years teenager - which is just plain unrealistic. Hermione and Ginny are young teens, regardless if girls are more mature than boys, they just seemed a bit too able to rise to every challenge with aplomb to be believed.Adverbs. OK, this didn't prevent me from enjoying the book. But there must be five on each page. That adds up. Nobody just speaks, they have to speak calmly, brutally, sadly, shortly, etc. This occurred so regularly, that it was easy not to be distracted by them.It also seemed like Rowling was determined that every character from a previous volume make a cameo appearance - from Dobby to Lockhart. While I appreciated this, at times I wished I could just learn more about the main characters like Neville. He'd disappear for pages and then Bam! there he was doing great at his defense lessons or visiting his parents at St. Mungo. Given that he's suffered similarly to Harry, it would be nice to see them contrasted more. (While Harry explodes, Neville implodes.)But OOPS is still a remarkable book.

Harry experiences so much trauma and self doubt, though, that after a while it's hard to read.

Harry doubts everything and everyone, all the time.  His outbursts, while understandable, grow old after a while.  He spends a great deal of this book shouting at anyone who will listen.  Ron and Hermione take a lot of abuse in this installment.  (and honestly, every boy should have a friend like Hermione to translate when encountering girls!)  Yes, all of this is part of growing up, and really was understandable, I guess I just wish the angst had been a little less overwhelming.

The Hogwarts students have grown up very fast, and the rapid changes in characters can be jarring.  They have as many unloveable traits as most adolescents.  Kudos to Rowling for displaying the warts on her heroes, although it makes her one-dimensional portrayals of the bad guys (with a single exception) more glaringly deficient.It's not an *enjoyable* book, especially.  If these are the times that try wizards' souls, Faithful Reader is tried along with them.  There's very little comic relief; the few victories bring bitter vindication rather than bubbling joy.  A defter touch with language might have made the struggles outlined in Book Five utterly compelling.

I found the book very dark and frustrating without some of the comic relief I've come to expect from Rowling. I suspected as I read along that the entire 800+ pages was such a huge machine grinding along to set up books 6 and 7 that I wondered how it would stand alone as a work of fiction.There were many enjoyable moments and some nice payoff in the deepening friendship among the three main characters. We get a glimpse into a few of the more minor characters and a large question mark around a family member. I wasn't surprised at the identity of the character who died.

Another thing that really dissappointed me was the death of an important character which was really crule considering its place in Harry's life and it's own misrable life - He deserved better.So why did I give this book a 5? because it was intersting, Reviting, full of adventures and wonderfully portrayed characters.

As Principal of an elementary school, I try to keep abreast of  the most popular books our children are reading. These books are certainly  popular. There is one tendency, however, the author seems to prefer to get  Harry out of trouble after he has been caught breaking the rules at home or  at Hogswart- the adults excuse (rescue)him from the consequences. The only  time Harry has been held accountable for a transgression was when professor  Snapes(I believe) gave him detention in book 1. In all three books there  are examples of the adults playing rescuing roles feeling sorry for Harry  perhaps because of his background or the current problem is which he is a  party( by choice most times). While I understand compassion, still here is  an area that perhaps needs a look if Ms. Rowling writes the fourth book.  Maybe Harry needs to get out of his own predicaments which may mean  suffering some consequences and the adults seen by the readers as  consistent in enforcing the rules, while still offering compassion, help  and encouragement.

Jim Dale's performance is remarkable.  It brings the story to life in a way that even the most vivid imagination couldn't.  His rendition of Dolores Umbridge is particularly effective.  Just reading the book can give you an idea just how creepy this character is, but hearing her brought to life by Mr. Dale in this audio book will make your skin crawl.

Granted, he has a lot going against a relaxing life, but it got to the point where I suspected that the plot would reveal that he was being influenced by the herb mentioned in middle of the book that causes people to lose their tempers.Otherwise, the plot was busy but not overly so (I can only imagine, however, what a chore it will be to film this in less than three hours).

Crabbe and Goyle could never have made it this far in the school, Snape's malevolence is getting really boring, it is unbelievable that an incompetent fool like Fudge is Minister of Magic, and the Inquisitor Umbridge is so extreme as to be totally unbelievable.

"1640",5,731195,TRUE,"This fifth volume of the Harry Potter saga was more than expected and it finally came out and it did not disappoint our expectations. This volume is interesting because it puts the first four volumes in a clear perspective as for Harry Potter's fate contained in a prophecy. This volume is interesting too because it shows how Harry Potter is able to summon around him a fair number of fellow students to fight against the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort. This is a great optimistic sign about young people who are able to fight against evil, against what is bad in the world. Then the adventure of the fight between the good forces and Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters is full of unexpected developments and surprises. But the book is also interesting because it shows how a government in our countries is easily choosing the third way that is the negation of evil forces and the rebuffing of good forces who denounce these evil forces. This is a clear cut syndrom in our societies today with the choice of that middle of the way policy that leads nowhere except to victimizing those who are the only defense against evil. Here we can wonder if Rowling is not aiming at those benevolent governments who do not have the courage to fight against what is wrong in our societies and prefer giving aspirin against cancer or coughdrops against tuberculosis. The next interest of this book is that good is identified with being good and humane with your fellow humans, with accepting differences between people, be they physical, psychological or cultural and moral, with refusing discrimination, any discrimination in any form. The final interest of this book is the description of school life when the head and the teachers try to impose control of and limitations on students rights. It creates havoc and it leads to catastrophes, especially when some teachers try to retain some knowledge and to prevent students from getting the full picture of what they can and want to know. Luckily young people seem to be able to resist and to find other ways to get the knowledge they need and want.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan",FALSE,2003,1474

Or is it just a coincidence, that Occlumency - a kind of mind-control - is taught by Snape, who is played by Rickman, whose best parts in earlier movies include Rasputin and Mesmer?

Harry is growing up and this is his transcription of growth.  Ms. Rowling has captured male adolescence with such an accurate view that it pains me to read this brooding self-loathing fifth installment of our young hero.Harry starts out as he does at the beginning of every year, at the Dursley's house of torment, only this year, Harry is changing.  Gone are the days of easy simple luck and easy heroics, Harry is starting to pout because it isn't going his way.  What he learns through the course of this book is the life lesson we all learn at one point or another, sometimes it isn't always about you.In the course of this weighty novel, we watch as Harry goes from hero to zero, from having a hold on things to breaking apart inside and out.  Will Harry be able to pull through this one?  Can he survive the biggest loss of all?  More importantly, is he ever going to learn to control that temper of his?I must confess, Harry's new attitude has taken a sour note with me.  I find myself bothered by people who think that it is okay to treat others with contempt and let their tempers get the best of them.  I find that Harry rarely receives the appropriate discipline and that even in the end of this well-crafted and riveting story, he still finds himself being rewarded for the wrong things and commended for the attitude he should not be holding on to.  How can a boy retain his friends when he shows no appreciation for them?  Don't get me wrong, I can completely understand his feelings and see his point of view, but I have to agree with Phineas' last chapter statement regarding Harry (SPOILER) when he says ""Never try to understand the students.  They hate it.  They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own -""Granted Harry is growing up, but where is his conviction?  Where is his heart?  How can a young man so full of rage really win over the ""Dark Lord?""  I thought the game was love > evil?  Not anger = passion > evil.

It is way too lengthy, a lot of unnecessary new characters and repetition of points make you wonder if Rowling is paid by the word count. The plot has too many holes yet much less suspense comparing to the previous 4 books. You could pretty much figure out what the climax scene would be 1/3 into the book and there's not enough suspense built-up leading to it. This makes the reading rather boring.The most disappointing (almost offending to readers' intelligence) part is the numerous ridiculous holes in the plot. To name a few: To the end, you don't see why the stupid ""thing"" is so important that it must be guarded like crazy (maybe more explanation coming in the 6th?). If it is indeed so critical, then why there is no guard in the final night and all sorts of people (dark forces and Potter et al) can get to it so easily?Why did Lord Voldemort make all of fuss of not going there to take it himself yet he finally showed up in the final night? If he had to show up anyway, isn't it more easier for him to do it himself right from the beginning? Why didn't Black remind Potter of the magical communication device (his parting gift)? He had numerous chance to mention it and yet he made all the ""trouble"" and ""danger"" to go through the fireplace thing instead of just telling Potter to use that gift ?!Think about these carefully you will see that there always seem to be some explanations, but none of them is convincing enough to warrant the existence of the 5th book at all. It is a total waste of time and assaulting your intelligence. The only good thing out of this lengthy reading is more character development comparing to the previous four.I would definitely not waste my time on this fiasco if I had the choice - I had to read it just to follow the series.

That being said, I think that Rowling once again demonstrates the ability to keep readers enthralled and craving more (at least I am).

Just a wonderful addition to the series.",FALSE,2003,1468
"3046",2,731189,TRUE,"...JK Rowling's problem is simple: She doesn't have anyone editing her anymore.Whereas the first three books were a slim 300-400 pages, long by children's book standards but a good size for a real novel, things have obviously gotten out of control. The page size alone has ballooned to an unhealthy 897 pages. If Rowling things that she can hold our interest by casually dropping names like ""Muddlewump"" and ""Fizz-Bangers"", she's sorely mistaken.I remember reading in an article that Rowling said the world is so filled-out, she could write a novel on every character who appears, from Draco Malfoy to Dedalus Diddle. This, my friends, is not necessarily a good thing. This means side plots galore - annoying, irrelevant side plots that plagued book 4, like Hermione's pointless campaign for the house elves, or the fake gold scam with the Weasley twins and Ludo Bagman.Fortunately this time around, Rowling has focused in on the one and only plot that matters - Harry vs. Voldemort. Because Harry is the only person who matters, and she seems to have realized this. The book has instead another problem - it's too dark, too depressing, and for too long. Harry's story is no longer pleasant to deal with, because it is so utterly depressing and obviously deeply traumatizing to him. He is often in a state of shock, physical or emotional pain, or some kind of depressed stupor from all the horrible stuff that continually happens to him, and it's quite painful to read. The reader misses the old Harry of the first three books, who was in wonder and amazement at the magical world, and had dangerous adventures because he wanted to, not because they were brought upon him. It set a lighter tone for the books and now that tone has become too dark for even the mature reader to want to deal with. Certainly, it's too long to deal with the subject in such a manner. The trials and tribulations of Harry Potter become almost painful to read about - we the readers become desperate for someone to come in and say or SOMETHING positive that actually helps.Much like the last 5 chapters of ""The Goblet of Fire,"" Harry's problems are so monumental and overwhelming that no one around him except Dumbledore is able to begin to comprehend, much less help him solve, them. This time, the problems only worsen and Dumbledore, the all-forgiving, all-knowing plot device is often not present. There is no comfort for Harry and none for the readers. His friends, remaining family, and the adults surrounding him become irrelevant because they are simply not relevant to this main plotline that concerns on him and Voldemort, and therefore unable to give him even the lightest bit of advice. His old supports of Ron, Hermione, and perhaps even Neville and Sirius occasionally try to comfort him, only to be confounded by the gravity of the events surrounding him. Harry Potter the plotline has outgrown them all. He is no longer the Boy Who Lived But Also Goes To School And Is A Quidditch Player, he is merely the Boy Who Lived.In an ideal world, where someone had the gall to stand up to Rowling and make suggestions, these might have been made:Book 4 ""The Goblet of Fire""""Gee, do you think you could cut the elf plotline? And the blackmail plotline? And the Yule Ball that goes nowhere? And Reeta Skeeter?""Book 5 ""Order of teh Phoenix""""Gee, could you please do something with Harry other than give him some new sort of deep-seeted trauma?""Rowling needs to be told that makes fun, exciting plots that involve Harry in some way but are not horribly depressing.I do not especially recommend this book. Well, certainlly anyone who's going to continue reading the series needs to read it, there's no way around that. But if you're going to get into the whole series (which is a worthwhile endeavor as a whole), don't get into it just so you can read this book, or you will be disappointed.

"3291",4,731191,TRUE,"While not as emotionally gripping as the Goblet of Fire with its personal high stakes (the fantastic Tri-Wizard tournament and the Dark Lord's personal attack on Harry Potter),Order of the Phoenix is a masterfully plotted read that succeeds on many fronts - it is a tale of Harry Potter growing up and as such it is full of frustration, emotion, and the reality of constantly changing relationships in an ever increasingly dangerous world.Without revealing any specific spoilers for readers who have not finished the story, the Order of the Phoenix starts off with a bang (or is it crack) and the events on Privet Drive soon leads Harry back to his fifth year at Hogwarts, with his enemies on more fronts than  before.  Harry's future career will be decided by his results of his OWLs (ordinary wizarding level exams), the new Defense Against Dark Arts professor will prove to be far more challenging than her girlish voice, the Ministry of Magic will prove be a political force to be reckoned with, Professor Snape will be as daunting as ever, You Know Who conjures darkness and death with his Death Eaters, and yes, raging hormones and romance will play a part (could it be someone from RavenClaw ?).The whole cast is back, from Lupin to Rita Skeeter to the Weasley twins, more mischievous and entertaining than ever.  And the good thing is, we learn many things about those around Harry, from the Dursleys to the Weasleys to even Professor Snape and we begin to really really understand what Harry has faced and what he is going to have to face in the upcoming two novels.  Growing up is never easy for anyone and Harry is definitely not going to have anything easy at 15 - not even Quidditch.  Harry is very angry in this book, like many teenagers caught in the awkward stage between child and adult yet possessed of certain powers beyond their years.  It is a stage where things change moment by moment, where there are stresses beyond belief, where there are awkward moments when one is neither adult nor child - and it is here that JK Rowling captures Harry's essence perfectly - Harry's confused adolescence and the continued evolving relationships of his friends, peers, and loved ones.Order of the Phoenix sets a marvelous stage for what's to come - it gives the reader the background and emotions to understand the harsh reality that is about to come into the wizarding world - that Lord Voldermort will bring much pain and suffering and that Harry must fulfill his destiny whether he wants to or not.  The dark tone from Goblet of Fire continues in this book but it is contrasted by the wild clever imagination of JK Rowling and her wonderful gift for making interesting new out of old - new spells, new magical creatures, new revelations, even new areas of the magical world such as the Ministry of Magic (love the location) or St. Mungo - hospital for magical maladies and injuries.I enjoyed the book immensely and heartily recommend this to all Harry Potter fans (and even to the minute Muggle minority that hasn't read the series).  Author JK Rowling provides a lot of great character background here and one can see the beginnings of plot lines and twists for Harry's final two years at Hogwarts.  Harry is changing, Hogwarts is changing, and even the Sorting Hat can sense the darkest time ahead - its a call for unity and I for one, cannot wait to see what happens next - I'm with you Harry and JK, even if I have to spend the summer with the Dursleys again.

"3552",2,731620,TRUE,"I loved books 1-4, but it seems Rowling wants to be considered a ""serious"" writer, and ended up writing abook more for her peers (which weren't authors when the series began, but commonfolk).  Specifically the book had two major flaws 1) plot flaws and 2) overly explanatory writing.1) Dumbledore stated at the end of this book that he has the ability to tell if someone is lying.  Yet in book 4, the teacher he hired ""Mad Eye Moody"", wasn't the one who showed up at school, but an imposter.  This low-level death eater lied to Dumbledore for an entire school year and he was none the wiser.Another plot error was when this low-level death eater ended up snagging Harry Potter right out from under the nose of Dumbledore, whose very presence at Hogwarts is supposed to protect Harry.  But this nobody beat Dumbledore's magic to get Harry's name into the triwizard tournament AND he then modified the winning trophy to transport two students right to Voldemort - where one of them died.Sure if that was Voldemort then I could see the argument, but some kid who got caught when he was 18, sent to Azkaban where he hasn't practiced magic for 12 years, then shows up and pulls the wool right over Dumbledore - that's a joke.2) The entire book was filled with uneccessary ""descriptive"" information.  Situations that had nothing to do with plot development, though arguably character development (but not quality character development).  Situations that make Harry look more like an ass than a real boy going through adolescence.  His stunning lack of concern for Cho Chang is prevalent thoughout the book.  Harry has almost no compassion or empathy for her, but the very wonderfulness of Harry is that he's just happy being a wizard, now she's trying to turn him into some dark hero, and doing a rather poor job of it.  The best she can come up with is ""It's hard being Harry"".The first four books, in this order:Sorcerer's Stone: ***** (5)Chamber Secrets: ***** (5)Prisoner of Azkaban: **** (4)Goblet of Fire: ***** (5)Order of the Phoenix: ** (2)",FALSE,2004,1899

They weren't particularly innovative, viewed objectively (consider the second, which begins with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and concludes with the hero stabbing a giant snake with a magic sword) but they did make you feel good at least.Phoenix waves away that emotional formula in favor of a more ambitious design, and so the book is  being praised for its ""improved"" depth and maturity... but the end result doesn't achieve anything very useful or innovative in the process.Rather, it transforms this series from classic children's fiction into mediocre-to-poor teen-audience fantasy.  This book tries to stir eight-year-old sex drive into  thirteen-year-old teen angst, and the unfortunate results aren't very tasty.Whiny, annoying characters, a slow plot which doesn't make a great deal of sense, a lot of condescendingly overt symbolism, scenes which feature so many people we aren't even sure who's there (and many of whom turn out after 870 pages to have been useless and serve no apparent function), settings that don't inspire but rather bore (magical governmental offices?!), and not even much of an exciting or surprising adventure story.As just one example,  consider the military tactics of Dumbledore.  Confronted with the reincarnation of the most evil Dark wizard of all time, his heroes spring into action by... housecleaning.I am not making this up.The earlier books featured surprises, twists, unexpected revelations.  This book offers nothing like that.  If a character seems to be X, rest assured, s/he is X.  The end.Worse still, the story proceeds at such a glacial pace, and is so tediously, terribly long, it's twice as bad as a normal bad book.  Nothing of any relevance to the plot really happens until the six hundred twentieth page (if you don't believe  me, look it up).Order of the Phoenix is like the 72 oz steak the Texas restaurant dares patrons to eat... but if you finish the whole thing, you don't get it free.

"3635",1,731191,TRUE,"OK, take a deep breath, shake off any Confundus Charms on you, draw yourself up bravely like Harry facing Voldemort, and admit the painful truth:  ""Phoenix"" is a bad book.  A very bad one.  A humorless, lumbering, convoluted, 900-page mess that acts as a combination Crucio and Stupefy spell to Harry's millions of loyal fans.Harry, now 15 and in his fifth year at Hogwarts, is no longer the awestruck 11-year-old from ""Sorceror's Stone"".  He spends most of ""Phoenix"" alternating between anger, frustration and sullenness, all understandable given his age and the tribulations he's endured.  Harry's typically joyless summer with the Dursleys is interrupted by a terrifying visit from a pair of dementors.  A mysterious howler arrives for Aunt Petunia, of all people.  Soon after, Harry finds himself at the headquarters of the ""Order Of The Phoenix"", a secret organization of anti-Voldemort witches and wizards working tirelessly to counter the second coming of the Dark Lord.All of this makes for a quite promising start.  But, the story bogs down faster than you can say ""Avada Kadavra"", the wizarding world's Unforgivable death spell than you will soon wish someone would hurl against you to put you out of the misery of having to finish this accursed novel.  ""Phoenix"" has too many new and unnecessary characters (the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher is particularly dreadful), too many subplots (few of which are adequately resolved), and far, far, far too many chapters.Most Unforgivable of all is the book's wholly unsatisfying ending.  Without leaking any spoilers, let's just say it's clear that author J.K. Rowling felt she was under a lot of pressure to get the manuscript finished, and it shows.  Loose ends and gaping logical holes abound.  There is a dreadful 'deux ex machina' feeling to the climatic battle scene.  Many of the mysteries she so tantalizingly introduced in the early chapters are explained away maddingly with the equivalent of a wrist-flick.Rowling's brilliant imagination and narrative gift are still visible in places, but it is as though they are entwined in Devil's Snare.  Please do not let Ms. Rowling's legions of apologists sell you that this book isn't as satisfying as its predecessors because it's more subtle, nuanced, or sophisticated.  This is nonsense.  It is none of the above.  It is just plain bad.If the strain on Harry is palpable in this novel, it is ten times so on Rowling.  The young British mom, like her famous creation, finds herself at the center of a worldwide storm she inadvertently created, one that must seem to her to have spun out of control.The Harry Potter series is too strong to be derailed by one terrible installment.  But, drastic adjustments need to be put in place for Books Six and Seven.  For starters, Rowling needs to take as much time as she wants to decompress and write Book Six, and if it requires ten years then so be it.  She also needs a dedicated editor or three, a continuity checker, and a publisher with the guts to take a 900-page manuscript from the world's most famous author and send it back with a yellow sticky note saying ""Great first draft, JK darling!

That is, if you enjoyed the others, you will very likely enjoy this one, too.Being said that, there are some minor considerations that made Order of the Phoenix less appealing to me:- As a reviewer mentioned, it's a ""coming of age"" book. I found myself frustrated by what I would call ""angry Harry"". In plenty of instances, Harry gets passionately angry and is not fully able to articulate his feelings. As a reader, I found that a little bit tiring.- This book narrates Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts but, opposite to the Goblet of Fire, the story's flow is not really assertive. Many chapters seem to begin with a ""the year passed very quickly and time for xxx came"". It's as if Ms. Rowling tried to fit the story within a one year timeframe to keep the flow of the series. It is a little bit artificial.- Plauseability: there are some (can't say it too many) situations and actions from key characters that are not fully reasoned. Ms. Rowling's characters are not complex human beings, but relatively simple characters with one clear trait/attribute. The simplicity of the characters makes some parts of the story less beliavable, less plausible.- Without trying to spoil the book for you, I found the closing chapters (where, as usual, Harry has to act in a very risky situation, confronting ""you know who"" and/or his followers) very short, and found a sort of ""accelerated finale"". Its like Ms. Rowling went a little bit too far with the previous chapters and suddenly she noticed she had to finish the book and then rushed to it.Again, the book is very nice and I recommend it.

K. Rowling continues to amaze with her writing talent, her creativity and her extraordinary organizational skills. Her prose is easy to read, her fantasies full blown and (once again) she successfully keeps track of the details as the story of Harry Potter, his friends and enemies, continues. At 870 pages, the Order of the Phoenix is the longest and I thought a bit too attentive to detail in the early stages, but that did not diminish my admiration for the author or the content of the story.Harry is now fifteen and in his fifth year at Hogwarts. He spends almost the entire book in a bad mood, not unusual for a teenage boy. He is introduced to the Order of the Phoenix and eventually learns they are charged with protecting him. In this book, Harry has a recurring dream of walking down a long corridor toward a closed door, which eventually opens for him, leading to all sorts of trouble and horror. Meanwhile, Hagrid is missing for a time. He returns somewhat worse for wear, but at least he's back, to the great relief of Hermoine, Ron and Harry. A dreadful witch wizard in the form of Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge arrives at Hogwarts and much of the story involves her treachery there. Harry's first introduction to her is at his hearing, brought about by his breaking the rules and using magic during his summer vacation on Privet Drive.As with the earlier books, pay close attention as you read. You will need the information provided early in the story to fully grasp the events at the end of The Order of the Phoenix as Harry continues to fight against the dark forces of the wizard world.Carolyn Rowe Hill",FALSE,2005,2193
"3905",5,732297,FALSE,"...the fact that a book's author sustained a tale long enough to fill such wide covers can be impressive in and of itself. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is (thus far) the longest and at the time of its publication in 2003, darkest, volume in the nearly-completed series of our favorite young wizard. At its release (and even today) this book earned praise as the best Harry Potter book to date, but I still maintain Goblet of Fire was a trifle better. I give Phoenix five stars, and it deserves them. It is the sort of book to lug off to your favorite chair and get lost in J.K. Rowling's fine storytelling and often deceptively lulling prose. In this massive novel, Harry hits his teen years, goes on his first real date, has some rough times that challenge the friendships he has with his closest comrades, we meet many members of the cast from the former books, and, yes, Harry loses yet another person who is close to him. We also begin in The Order of the Phoenix, to catch tell-tale glimpses into both the coming war that shall divide the non-Muggle world, and also gain insights into both Harry Potter's past, and his future.  The arrival of a thoroughly wicked new D.A.T.D.A. (fans will know what that stands for) teacher serves to add moments of torment to Harry's already tumultuous life, and we readers share his emotions right along with him. The closing chapters of this novel provide some of the most exciting (but alas all too brief) events in the entire series, and show us for the first time both the malicious might of He Who Shall Not Be Named, and also why Dumbledore is the only wizard he ever feared. The Order of the Phoenix is not  a disappointment, but it does leave some vital questions not just unanswered, but murkier than ever. I won't list them here, but they're hard to miss. As with all four of its predecessors and its most recent successor, The Half-Blood Prince, the delight in this series is not only in its deftly-interwoven storytelling or its escapist qualities, it comes from inside this delightful sensation that we are being let in on a secret. In case there's anyone left who hasn't already: read this book. You'll be glad you did.",FALSE,2006,2576
"3907",4,731928,FALSE,"After the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, I realized that I hadn't read the fifth book in the series. So I did. At the age of 15, Harry, Ron and Hermione are growing up, reflected in the fact that the material within the book is also maturing. For example, The Chamber of Secrets (book two) begins with the Dursleys locking Harry in his room for ""misbehavior,"" and Harry being rescued by the Weasley boys in their magical car. It seems trivial, but those were the Innocence Days of Harry Potter.The Order of the Phoenix begins with a strong dose of magic, wherein Harry is attacked by Dementors (you'll never guess who sends them) and leaves the Dursley's accompanied by members of the Order of the Phoenix, wizards and witches committed to preventing the return of Lord Voldemort and protecting the people he victimizes- whoch of course includes Harry. Harry is simply not a little boy anymore, and the magic within the later books involves much more complex spells, more advanced magic, and more sophisticated language on the whole. While some younger readers may not like it, that is the formula to which the Harry Potter series is now turning. And I must say that it works commendably.I suspect that OoP will be the longest book in the series altogether. At 870 pages (hardcover), Rowling takes even longer than before to get Harry and co. back to Hogwarts- which irked me a little- but then I realized that Rowling wasn't just dithering, and that everything that happens happens for a reason. (Half Blood Prince is a good 200 pages shorter than OoP, which leads me to think that book seven will be longer still). I liked this book because J.K. Rowling does a fantastic job of contrasting Harry's two worlds. On one hand there is the world of Hogwarts, in which the bully Malfoy plays a small role, and in which Harry worries about Quidditch matches and not being chosen to be a prefect- small fry compared to what else happens in this very thick book. Then there is the world outside of Hogwarts. Rowling spends about 200 pages at the beginning in which the threat of Lord Voldemort is set up. This threat, of course, is the real and serious danger, where the most important magic occurs.The school year is marked by the arrival of Dolores Umbridge, a member of the Ministry of Magic who sets up shop as a ""theoretical"" Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. She won't allow the students to actually practice what she preaches; and she is bent upon ""inspecting"" the teachers at the school and weeding out those who are unsatisfactory to her. Soon, as High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, free speech in favor of Harry Potter and Dumbledore is banned. It is pretty obvious what Professor Umbridge's motive is when Dumbledore confesses to a crime he did not cimmit, and Umbridge takes over as Head of Hogwarts.We also learn something interesting: that Sirius, Molly Weasley, and Lucius Malfoy (all pureblood magic folk) are cousins by various marriages. I also liked the way in which Rowling fills in the gaps of Neville Longbottom's story, as well as that of Professor Snape. They are no longer simply a klutz who has unfortunate things happen to him, and a decidedly unpleasant Hogwarts teacher, but real and intriguing figures. What was also interesting is that Harry learns some interesting things about his parents, who were at school with Snape.In all, I really do believe that the Harry Potter series is really fantastic. Although I am not normally a reader of fantasy and science fiction, the sheer popularity of the books drew me to reading them in the first place; and I ended up being immensely satisfied by Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban. There was an innocence to those books which was lacking in the later two (and, from what I've heard, the sixth book as well). While J.K. Rowling's books became longer, her subject became more and more complex and intense- sometimes a good thing, sometimes bad.Although the descriptions of the six books that have been released so far indicate that they are for the ages of 9-12, really the Harry Potter series is meant to be for people of all ages. For example, I'm twice the age of that targeted age group, and I was gripped by the subject matter as well as the way Rowling is able to make her readers care about the outcome of a story. I recommend that you read the first four books in the series before tackling this last one and the latest.FYI: the movie of this book has been slated to be released in 2007. As of this writing, only the three main actors have been signed. I personally think that Judi Dench would make a great Dolores Umbridge.",FALSE,2005,2207
"3911",5,731912,FALSE,"By far, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was my favorite of the five current books (I eagerly await volume six, which is coming out very soon).  The Harry Potter series, which started out a bit childish, picked up major points with the introduction of the second volume, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  In fact, I read volume two first, then each succesive volume afterward in order, ending then with the first after having finished with the fifth.  In my findings, each successive volume outstripped the last.  I remember thinking ""this is one of the best books I've ever read"" after every one.  OotP (Order of the Phoenix) was in no way a disappointment.The common consent of most people I've talked to about this book was that it is darker and more serious than the other volumes.  Many of the reviews I have read here and abound make the same point.  I couldn't agree more - things are much more serious in OotP than in any of the first three novels (the fourth volume already reflects the change of tone and serves as a transition).  What's more, Harry is buffeted by both internal and external pressures.  The weight of his being is more prevailent than ever before; he, Harry Potter, was the only one to survive the deadly killing curse Voldemort had used so successfuly prior to his attempt to murder Harry.  And he hadn't the faintest clue why.  In OotP, the reason for this is finally disclosed, and Harry learns of his ultimate destiny.External (and therefore more literal and straightforward) pressures for Harry include end-of-the-year exams (O.W.L.'s), the increase in his workload in preparation for the last, and the complex initiatives of one Dolores Umbridge.  Replete in all qualities that would serve a dark wizard (was she a Slytherin?), Umbridge was instead the product of the Ministry of Magic, headed by the ignorant and paranoid Cornelius Fudge.  She entered the school as part of the Ministry's plans to keep an eye on headmaster Albus Dumbledore.  The main conflict of views centered around the events Harry witnessed in his fourth term: he and Dumbledore knew the truth, that Voldemort had returned.  Fudge, not relishing the concept of the return of the Dark Lord, instead assumed a paranoid state and came to believe that Dumbledore was stirring up trouble in an attempt to overthrow him as Minister of Magic.  Fudge's paranoia drove him to assign Dolores Umbridge a position at Hogwarts and to continue taking more and more control of the school.  Fudge and Umbridge focused on keeping Harry Potter silent about the whole score.  This involved baiting the press and leading the public to believe that Harry was nothing more than a lying little brat.  Harry was forced to deal with the pressure of people all around who believed the Ministry's version of events and regarded him as a young attention-seeking fool.Despite my severe desire to grasp Umbridge and choke her, I must admit that some of Rowling's finest work was devoted to this character.  There is a certain degree of understanding one might offer to a person who is straightforwardly evil.  One feels much more contempt for someone who is subtle and manipulating as well as malicious.  Dolores Umbridge is a masterpiece in that she was a character I hated more than Lord Voldemort.  For him, I might suffice to have a quick Avada Kedavra and be done with it, but for Umbridge, I would reserve only the most painful death.  She had (as the book-sleeve accurately points out) a ""personality like poisoned honey.""  And she's not just a fictional character; she represents a type of person we have all come across before: the brutal authoritarian dictator.  Her charm only went so far as to secure what she wanted.  Her malice was skinned with but never disguised by a perpetually sweet and girlish cast.  She put thought into her evil, as well.  She used the spirit of house disunity to her advantage by appealing to the house of ambition and spite, the one that most closely mirrored her own character, Slytherin.  Her arrogance was marked; her opinion of the students (particularly those who opposed her) was loathsome.  She was the epitome of someone people should universally hate.Another satire was the actions of the press.  Though exaggerated somewhat (not too much, though, when compared to the press in the US), the press in OotP resembles the biased media in many countries.  A minority (the Ministry in HP) took control of the media and not only spread its propaganda, but chastized anyone who believed differently than they.  This goes on in America today, though I am glad to say that times are changing.  J.K. Rowling had quite an important message there, if anyone was paying attention.I did say this would be a critical review.  There were portions of the book which I thought to be poorly structured.  The most notable of these was the period around Christmas break.  I thought this part was tremendously boring; I chose to stop reading at this point and go to sleep the first time I read the book.  This place is also depressing and dark; almost foreshadowing, in a way.  I also though that the text dwelled a bit too much on Sirius's mood.  He certainly was an important character, but I feel that too much was given away by constantly including details about his expression and aura.  Also, the fight scene at the climax was disjointed and somewhat unrealistic.  Often times the Death Eaters seemed to have a chance to kill any of Harry's friends, but instead resorted to Stunning and temporary means of debilitating them.  Also, it seemed like there was a lot of standing and staring each time one of the group came upon some Death Eaters.  I think Avada Kedavra could have been slipped into some of those gaps.  I'm not saying I wanted anyone to die, it's just that there were too many opportunities where people *could* be killed and were not.My last point is that I was gypped before I read the book: J.K. Rowling herself gave an interview and gave away a major part of the plot - I won't say what it was because I was very disappointed and I don't want to pass that on.  Still, though, I was robbed.  I learned my lesson; for the sixth book, I'm not going to find out ANYTHING!  No way will I miss out on this one!  I only have two worries, though: I wonder if Rowling might have run out of steam (I hope not) and I worry that if she somehow dies before the seventh book is written, what will happen?!  I certainly hope neither happens, and I'll return to OotP now.  It's a very good book and an essential component in the series.  Also, being the longest of the six so far (the sixth will be shorter than both the fourth and fifth volumes), OotP is a bit tiring on the arms after awhile (especially the hard-cover edition!).  Even so, it's a compelling read and at no time did I ever feel anything less than a mad drive to finish the book.",FALSE,2005,2191

For You-Know-Who is on the loose, dementors and convicts run amok and the world turning against Harry. No one believes his tale of Lord Voldemort's return, least of all the reactionary forces in the Ministry of Magic. The media is portraying Harry as a loose cannon and a liar, only adding loneliness and humiliation to his already-long list of troubles. Harry himself is tormented by dreams, and must struggles with the question of whether his mind is completely under his control.With the willfully-blind Cornelius Fudge in the ascendancy at the Ministry of Magic, hard times are coming to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Fudge is taking advantage of the public's turn against Harry to do some housecleaning, moving one of his toadies, Dolores Umbridge, into the school. Umbridge wants to return the school to a tame wizarding orthodoxy, and soon institutes a reign of repression that only adds to Harry's woes.""The Order of Phoenix,"" the fifth in the J.K. Rowlings series on the wizarding world of Harry Potter, takes us into the world of politics as it is applied to the magical realm. As Voldemort and his acolyte Death Eaters scheme for control, the rest of the magical world is divided against itself. On one side are a small group of wizards and witches called the Order of the Phoenix, who have allied themselves with Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore to fight Voldemort. On the other side are the throngs of regular witches and wizards who are swayed by the credulous slanders against Potter and Dumbleore printed in the Daily Prophet and Quibbler. The anti-Dumbledore side is also tinged by a form of racism, in which anyone of ""half-breed"" status - be it centaur, half-giant like Hagrid, or a mixed-breed ""mudblood"" like Harry and Hermione - faces discrimination and disdain.Rowling's 5th book, builds upon the first four, delivering fascinating new creatures, new characters (Luna Lovegood, loopy daughter of the publisher of a scandalsheet) and new magical features of Hogwarts. The old favorites still appear - Professors McGonagall and Snape, the Dursleys and Weasleys, Sirius Black, Dobby the house-elf and many others. The sense of danger increases, as does the sense of paranoia and despair, as Harry is loaded down with far heavier burdens than any 15-year-old should have to shoulder. Yet Harry is learning to depend on his fellow students for aid, even learning that the least desirable of his acquaintances play enormously important roles in his life.""Order of the Phoenix"" is darker than the rest, properly so in view of the rise in Voldemort's strength and influence.

Though I think it's a little different in tone to the others, it's probably my favorite so far, I like it just a whisker more than ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"".After the dramatic, tragic end of ""Goblet of Fire"", Harry's summer is suspiciously quiet. He rarely gets letters from his school friends, and when he does they are brief and vague. He needs to talk to someone, and being pent up with his aunt and uncle after such a traumatic school year is causing him a lot of anger and frustration. When he and his cousin are attacked by Dementors in the park, it seems that enough is enough, and he is whisked away by the mysterious ""Order of the Phoenix"", of which many of his adult friends are members. That's not the only order Harry has to deal with before school starts, for defending himself against the Dementors, he's gotten a court order from the Ministry of Magic, threatening to expel Harry if they find him guilty. That's not to say he wont have problems if he does make it back to school, he's got the OWL exams looming, plus the Ministry have appointed a certain Professor Umbridge as a teacher, a woman who has the power to change the very way the school operates, and is all too willing to use it. This might just be a very tough year for Harry. Will he make it through?It's a very thick book, this one (more than 750 pages) and though the chapters aren't as encouragingly short as they were in ""Goblet of Fire"", it was fairly easy going. The characters, locations and subplots keep getting developed, while the new characters to the book (like Tonks and Mundungus Fletcher) and new locations (like the House of Black, the Hog's Head and the Ministry of Magic complex) keep things fresh. Professor Umbridge's character was a curiously crafted one, I thought. She's a sinister sweet government official who plays favorites with the students, meddles with tried and tested teaching traditions, and tries to control what is being said by both students and professors in her soft but forceful way. She is one of the most infuriating characters I've ever read, this concentration of really nasty traits you wouldn't want an authority figure to have. The parallels between the Hogwarts exams and the real-life ones (complete with careeer pamphlets, study schedules and heavy workloads) were interesting too. It's a little satirical, actually.

The children's story is over, as well as most of the amazement the readers felt due to the novelty of Hogwarts, a witches' world, enchanted bathrooms, and killer trees. Now the Harry Potter saga is mostly about the eternal fight between good and evil. Fortunately, as it happens in most of those unforgettable good vs. evil stories - ""Star Wars"", ""The lord of the rings"", and even ""Schindler's list"", why not? -  the main characters are the central pillar of this fantastic saga.Once again, Harry Potter and his usual best friends - Hermione and Ron Weasley - are back in Hogwarts to course their fifth year, and to finally enter the wizards' proper world, as at the end of their term they have to pass the Ordinary Magic Level tests. It would be a hard year nonetheless, but there's something that will certainly make it harder for them. A certain Lord Voldemort, Harry's nemesis, is coming back, and he gets stronger every minute. Even with the help of the Order of Phoenix, a misterious group of ""good wizards"", Harry's struggle will be extremely hard.""The goblet of fire"" may be  the best book in the series, because of many memorable moments, and the first face-to-face encounter between Harry and Voldemort in his new/old form. ""The order of Phoenix"" is interesting in another way. The book focuses mostly on Harry, a discredited boy, whom everybody thinks is crazy and delusional about a powerful black wizard coming back to life. Now Harry is fifteen, a full teenager. J. K. Rowling was able to tell in the pages of her book how difficult this period of life is to everyone. Insecure, alone, bad-tempered, this is a new, but very realistic Harry Potter, a person in the transition from childhood to adult life. There's even a love scene in this book! - and all the complications love interests generate from a first kiss.The good thing about the Harry Potter series is that Rowling knows how to tell her story. With great characters, that we already know and care for, and many things happening at all times, it's impossible not to want to know what's going to happen next. Let's wait until ""The half-blood prince"".Grade 8.9/10",FALSE,2005,2142
"3923",5,731572,FALSE,"Why do the Harry Potter books do so well? Because, unlike so many fiction books for adults, the author's main goal is to entertain. This is a child's book in the sense that it is written from the viewpoint of a child, and everything stems from that. The characterisations are excellent, and wonderfully vivid. Many people complain about Harry's attitude, but I think it was very well done. Harry has been through, and experiences in this book, some truly horrible things, for anyone let alone a kid. The depiction is very good, and I think accurate, and it definitely earned my sympathy for him. Also, his friends provide him some great support, and in my opinion especially when Harry might otherwise cross the line to annoying me. Most of all, most of Harry's outbursts are a direct response to the government's teacher lying or abusing his friends, and Harry doesn't let the knowledge that he will in turn be abused stop him. I have read adult books where the political abuse went unchallenged so long I got too frustrated to continue reading, so I really enjoyed that theme.This book is quite different from the preceding books, in terms of pacing, style of events, and how many characters it features. There are many more active characters, and more attention given to defining their personalities. Existing characters also gain a great deal of depth, and it is usually in quite surprising ways. The pacing and style is that of a political war, as it should be. That is, one side acts, there is a lag and then a reaction from the school body or the general public, then the other side responds, and so on. Things take time to proceed. Also, the classes are the most intense yet, and they are intertwined with the school's politics. There are a number of other plot threads that develop over time. Rowling uses this time to give us a lot of information about the wizarding world, and a lot of back story on Harry's parents' time at Hogwarts. I found the information very interesting, but others feel the story should move faster (mostly adults, as far as I can tell). Finally, Rowling usually has only one big surprise before those at the end of the book. This book is a bit like Chamber of Secrets, in that there are a number of shocking events that come as real surprises. There are also more, or at least bigger shocks and surprises in the final chapters than ever before. At any rate, I thought the pacing and style were very good and well judged. Taking more pages to present events and information has worked out very well.There is one flaw in this book for me as an adult reader: Harry's romance is not very well done. Harry being clueless about girls is entirely appropriate. Harry spent a lot of time thinking about a girl in the last book. Now he is dating her but rarely thinking of her, which is most of his problem. His and also Ron's reactions are really immature for their age. It is in sharp contrast to that of Hermione and the other girls, even younger ones, as well. It is not clear whether Rowling is making a concession to younger readers, or whether this is the one area in which she understands girls but boys.This is my longest review yet, so I better give the important information here. I think the book is very well written, the pacing well judged, the plot lines intriguing, and the characterisation excellent. Most of all, it is wonderfully entertaining, which is my most important criteria for fiction. I really enjoy reading it.",FALSE,2004,1851
"3934",5,731551,FALSE,"I remember reading the very first Harry Potter book many years ago and being completely taken in by the story's imaginative and completely original premise. The series has not disappointed me since. Now that the third film is just around the corner, I thought it would do me good to go back to the series' third book to rediscover its magic all over again.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favorites from the series. This time, Harry returns to Hogwarts for his third year only to learn a terrible piece of news. A man named Sirius Black, who just happens to be Harry's Godfather, has escaped the prison of Azkaban. Believed to be a very dangerous murderer, many think that Black is going to try Harry the moment he gets the chance. The readers get to learn a great deal about Harry's past and about his parents. And, as in all the Potter books, the truth isn't always what it first appears to be...But Harry, as the series has thought us, isn't easily frazzled. Although his third year is disturbed by Black's escape (creatures called the Dementors, the dark and violent creatures that guard the Azkaban prison roam the school grounds, the constant threat of not knowing where Black truly is...), there is a lot more Harry needs to worry about. First of all, he wants to win the Quiddich cup. He wants to visit Hogsmeade, the only wizard town in England. And he also wants to help Hagrid save one of his mystical creature that is supposed to be executed by the end of the school year. And he still needs to study and attend all of his classes in order to graduate, even when the amount of work becomes unbearable. And, scariest of all, he still has to deal with Professor Snape's hatred.A series of new characters are introduced. We have the new wacky teacher of Diviniation, as well as Lupin, the new Dark Arts teacher (and one of my favorite characters in the book). And all the regulars we have come to love and cherish are back for one more round.This is a darker and scarier effort from Rowling's part. There are a many very intense scenes that lead to the incredible finale. It still amazes me to see how much imagination and wit Rowling has. Her books are so vividly written and so brilliantly executed that there isn't a great deal to dislike about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (or the series in its entirety for that matter).

"3935",5,732234,FALSE,"Order of the Phoenix is by far, the deepest, most important Harry Potter novel to this point in the series.  Extremely long, the book still reads like a quick 300 page book that you wouldn't think twice about reading.  All 870 pages of this novel are entertaining, funny, thrilling, and frustrating.  This novel is by far the most frustrating one that I have read so far in the series.  It seems like nothing can go right for Harry for the first 600 pages.  He is constantly moody with his friends, awkward with his crushes, and always getting into trouble with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Dolores Umbridge.  Umbridge is by far the most annoying character that Rowling has created yet.  And that is good thing.  She is an amazing antagonist for the entire novel, and somehow makes Harry's life even worse than Snape possibly could on his worst day.This book is also amazing due to how Rowling professionally weaves the story of Harry's school life (it's fifth year, and all students must take the O.W.L. tests) with the implications of the war going on outside of Hogwart's.  A war that almost no one truly believes is going on.  After finishing this book, I immediately started the Half-Blood Prince because I was so eager to continue with the story of the second war beginning.Quite a lot is revealed in Order of the Phoenix.  A lot of it is extremely complicated, but yet vital to putting the story where it needs to be for the end to come.  Near the end of the book, when Harry and Dumbledore are sitting in his office at Hogwart's and Dumbledore pretty much spills the beans on everything that is going on and everything he has been keeping from Harry, is maybe the best scene in the entire series.  The interaction between Harry and Dumbledore is amazing and also extremely meaningful, and not just in the world of Harry Potter, much that is said could easily be applied to our own world.In short, Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter novel yet.

Does he start to develop a teenagers attitude? YES. Does he start to learn what his place in the grand scheme of things is? YES. There is more to Harry in this book than many ""adult"" novels characterize for their protagonists.4 - It reminds you about what it was like to be a teenager feeling those first confusing pains of romance. Should I kiss her? Should I hold her hand? Why is she crying? What did I say wrong? Harry and Cho is a fun relationship to see begin...and possibly end. However, the best one is the budding romance between Ron and Hermione...and it's doubtful that either one sees it happening.5 - Good villains abound in this story. The new D.A.T.D.A. professor is a royal pain in the broomstrick. Never have I read through a novel where I prayed to see a character get what they deserve until I met Dolores Umbridge. Aside from her there's also the mystery and vileness of Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters (Come on, how can you even say ""Death Eaters"" without expecting someone to die?).6 - Someone dies! And it shows that not every death need be heroic. The death also serves the point of helping other characters develop.7 - The complex relationship between Harry and Professor Snape. Snape has gone from a wood-be suspect in the first few books to a rich character. I find myself most looking forward to the chapters where these two characters interact. The best chapter of Order of the Phoenix by far is the one entitled ""Snape's Worst Memory"". To think that an antagonist to Harry like Snape might actually make the readers feel sorry for him...and then hate him again all in the span of a few pages. That's just good writing!8 - Action! For 800+ pages the book certainly moves quickly. And even though we can enjoy some familiar staples (Quidditch, walks in the Forbidden Forest), there's also plenty of new things.9 - Dialogue. J.K. Rowling does a phenomenal job with her dialogue. As a teacher of 13 year olds, I find that when I read the Harry Potter books the kids talk and act like...KIDS. Now many of them talk and act like 15 year olds. Rowling does an incredible job of listening to kids in her real life because what flows from her pen just sounds genuine.10 - IT MAKES KIDS WANT TO READ.

Unfortunately, since then it has become apparent that Voldemort's disappearance was only temporary, and his desire to kill Harry has not lessened.It proves to be a particularly tough year for him, both academically and personally. In fifth year, Hogwarts students take their OWLs - wizard's exams - so his workload has increased dramatically. Also, after the events outlined in ""The Goblet of Fire"", both Harry and Dumbledore are being viewed with scorn by the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet. Neither organisation is willing to believe that Voldemort is back, fully recovered - and seem determined to discredit both Dumbledore and Harry. In fact, it is said that any Ministry employee is in league with Dumbledore will be fired immediately.Luckily, there are those who know better. The Order of the Phoenix is a secret society formed by Dumbledore, consisting of people who had fought Voldemort previously. Several of its members have appeared in previous books, and include Mr and Mrs Weasley, Sirius Black, Professor Lupin, Mad Eye Mooney and Severus Snape. Unfortunately, they seem determined to tell Harry and his friends as little as possible about their plans and what Voldemort is up to. The Order's headquarters are at 12 Grimmauld Place, the ancestral home of the Blacks. Like Harry, Sirius is having difficulty coping with the situation. As an Azkaban escapee, he can't leave the house in case he is spotted - even though he'd much prefer to be offering more practical help.There have been a couple of changes at Hogwarts also. Almost inevitably, there's a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. A thoroughly obnoxious woman, she is also Senior Under-Secretary to the Minister of Magic. In a speech she makes after the sorting of the first years, she basically admits she is there to interfere with the running of Hogwarts. As the year progresses, she proves true to her word - additionally her teaching is woefully inadequate. Another new teacher introduced at the start of the school year is Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be teaching Care of Magical Creatures - previously taught be Hagrid. Hagrid, of course, had been sent on a secret mission by Dumbledore at the end of the previous school year.As with the previous instalment, ""The Goblet of Fire"", this is a very long and very enjoyable addition to the series. It's very easily read and will be enjoyed by both children and adults. However, before reading this book, I'd suggest reading ""The Goblet of Fire"" at the very least. Much of what happens there has a direct impact on the events of this book. Ideally, though, I'd recommend reading all the books in order - there are all very enjoyable!",FALSE,2004,1805
"3943",5,731584,FALSE,"Once again Rowling has a way of putting the reader through every emotion on the spectrum.I must admit that I hated it at points, but not in a bad way. I hated to see Harry go through all he had to here. He has to lose so much and deal with so much whether in school or at home with the Dursleys but somehow Harry survives and knows what he has to do. I guess that which doesn't kill him will make him stronger is a great lesson to take away from this book.Overall this is probably the darkest of the books. Killing, fears that the characters have to deal with, some of the worst ordeals for anyone to have to deal with and just people who you wish Harry could just punch out for good without even having to use his wand (Snape and Draco come to mind).The Order of the Phoenix goes into great detail on a lot of things that were devloped over the first four books. This is a must read to find out a lot of connections, lots of things you have been wondering and just for a very well written story. It breaks the formula a bit that the other books had established and really will have you flipping through pages non-stop trying to find out what happens next. Even as I was reading I was frustrated that Harry couldn't figure out things, or that he seemed powerless at times to do things.In the fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry has to return to a school that the ministry of magic is trying to take control of, due to Dumbledors claims that Lord Voldemort has indeed returned. A new Dark Arts teacher in the name of Umbridge works for the Ministry and starts to try and take over the school in the hopes of one of the biggest cover ups about Lord Voldemort. All the while Harry has to deal with his biggest exams yet in the O.W.L.S that will shape what his future will be. He has to deal with bad nightmares he is constantly having and along the way many of his friends step in to help him. It truly is a great book. Not the best of the series but on par with the same quality and adventure you have come to expect from the series.This is a must read. I won't give the whole book away here, this is something you must read for yourselves. It has great character development and so much information that you may want to re read some parts to see if you actualy picked it all up. While I don't totaly agree with the very dark feel that it has at points, I do agree that this is a great series for people of all ages and I can't stop reading it.

"3944",5,731537,FALSE,"In book 5, Harry becomes more self reliant and is tired of being treated as just a kid. A group of good wizards called the Order of the Phoenix take Harry into hiding. Harry and his friends are fed up that the order won't tell them what's going on. So while back at Hogwarts Hermione convinces Harry to start a secret class where he teaches students to defend themselves against such evil as Voldemort. Not many people believe Harry that Voldemort is back though. So there's only a few students who join Harry's secret class. Harry's crush Cho Chang joins though and the 2 get closer. Harry learns that dating isn't that easy though and it's not long before the 2 are arguing and fighting.  On top of things there's a new Professor at Hogwarts, Dolores Umbridge who's a mean toad looking women. Right away she seems to have it out for Harry. She keeps giving him detention which gets in the way of him playing Quidditch. Ron joins the Quidditch team and is the new Keeper. The problem is that he's really bad and with Harry getting detention all the time their team keeps losing because of Ron.  Harry keeps having dreams about a secret door at the Minestry of Magic. Dumbledore has Harry take a special class with Snape to help make the dreams go away. Harry is stubborn though and he really wants to get closer to that door in his dreams and see what's behind it. He also takes dangerous risks of getting in trouble by Dolores Umbridge who takes over Hogwarts. He thinks Sirius is in trouble and the only way to talk to him is to break into Umbridge's office and use her fireplace. Harry gets news from Sirius's angry old house elf that Sirius was captured by Voldemort. So then he has to figure out how to get around Umbridge to save his Godfather. This one has less action but the fantasy and wonder are still there. There's tons of action once Harry and his friends make it to the Minestry of Magic though. There's a lot of wand on wand action with good vs evil during that part. Plus we finally get a comfrontation between Voldemort and Dumbledore as well. Anyway this is a really good book. It's as dark as Goblet of Fire with a moodier, more stubborn and more grown-up Harry.  I would say this one is more for older kids than really young ones, probably 8 and up.",FALSE,2004,1816
"3945",5,731966,FALSE,"True Story: As I was sitting in a park reading this third installment in one of fiction's all-time great series, an elderly woman came over to me, scowling, and announced, ""You shouldn't read that filth."" I asked why and she told me, ""Those aren't even words on those pages, they're symbols disguised as letters, and the Devil wrote that book to lead the world astray with stories of magic and demonology. If you were a pure Christian you'd see those pages for what they really were and you'd repent.""Uh-huh. It takes all kinds, doesn't it?Anyway, HPATPOA takes off at the end of the summer following the events in The Chamber of Secrets. Harry is back, older and stronger in his magical skills, as are Hermione and Ron, the odious Draco Malfoy, the lovable Hagrid and all the rest, along with new characters like Professor Lupin, and a delightful new locale, the village of Hogsmeade. In this installment we are introduced to the Knight Bus, to Dementors, and to Harry's Aunt Marge, a sarcastic oaf who gets inflated like  a balloon and sent floating off over Muggledom. It's a new year challenges for all, especially for Hermione, as she receives permission to take an extra class, and does so with the help of a magical object that turns back time! The plot revolves, though, around the escape from Azkaban Prison of a notorious criminal named Sirius Black. Black had been convicted of the betrayal of Harry's parents that led to their murder thirteen years before. He also cold-bloodedly killed several of his own friends and would gladly have delivered the world itself over to You Know Who, had he not been apprehended and sentenced to the most secure prison ever designed. Now free, Sirius is believed to be headed for Hogwarts to finish the job his master began and murder Harry!This book is the longest of the first three, but in my view not quite as dark as its immediate predecessor. A lot of new people who factor into later events are first introduced here and Rowling allows time to explore the world around Hogwarts more than in the past, and also deepen the historical background against which this series plays out. Another fabulous volume in the best fantasy series since The Lord of the Rings!",FALSE,2005,2245
"3948",5,731511,FALSE,"First published in 1999, the book covers Harry's third year at Hogwarts and begins with the end of the summer holidays approaching. The previous summer, at the start of the Chamber of Secrets, Harry had been blamed by the Ministry of Magic for a spell performed by Dobby in Dursley's house. This summer, Harry panics as he accidentally casts a spell on a thoroughly obnoxious aunt. Convinced he was going to be expelled from Hogwarts, he decides to go on the run - but, before long the Minister for Magic corners him at Diagon Alley. Harry is somewhat surprised to be let off, given the trouble he got into the previous year - but relieved all he same.The Magic Community seems to be much more concerned with a very dangerous criminal called Sirius Black who has become the first person to escape from Azkaban (the wizard prison). He had been sent there after being found guilty of murdering thirteen people - twelve of them muggles - with a single curse about twelve years earlier. Widely believed to be have been a big supporter of Voldemort's, the rumour is he's hunting for Harry. As a result, some Azkaban guards (disgusting creatures, known as Dementors) have been posted at Hogwarts for the protection of the pupils and staff.Harry is, once again, joined by Ron and Hermione at Hogwarts. There's a bit of trouble between the trio this year, however. Much of that is caused by Hermione's new pet Crookshanks - a crazy cat, who seems determined to kill Ron's rat, Scabbers, at every opportunity. There are further some changes to life at Hogwarts. This year's Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, is Professor Lupin who proves hugely popular with the majority of pupils. Despite the fact he dresses rather shabbily and gets strangely ill from time to time, Lupin actually seems to know what he's doing - unlike the previous post-holders, Professor Quirrell and Professor Gilderoy. However, it's obvious that Snape despises him nearly as much as he despises Harry. Although it's no secret that Snape has always wanted the Defence Against The Dark Arts, there seems to be a depth of feeling Quirrell and Gilderoy were spared.The three friends are also taking a couple of new subjects in their third year. One of these is Care of Magical Creatures, taught by their old friend, Hagrid. Unfortunately, his first lesson leads to trouble with a Hippogriff. Another is Divination, taught by Professor Trelawney - who seems to be something of a crackpot. She apparently foresees at least one student's death every year, and this year picks on Harry. She somehow picks out the Grim (a death omen) from Harry's tealeaves. Harry probably wouldn't have been too worried, only he'd already seen something of a death omen when he was leaving Privet Drive.This is the third book in the Harry Potter series and, for me, is comfortably the best in the series. It's an excellent story, with has a strong mystery element running through it, and is very easily read. I probably would be better reading the series in order. However, that shouldn't be too much of a burden, as the previous two books are also very enjoyable !",FALSE,2004,1790
"3949",5,731594,FALSE,"I didn't start reading the Harry Potter series until ""Goblet of Fire"" was published - just in time to endure the monster wait for ""Order of the Phoenix"". I tore through the first four books with utter delight. After hearing the ridiculous amount of controversy surrounding these works, I was prepared for shoddy writing and nefarious, subversive pseud-literature. Obviously, I found neither.""Order of the Phoenix"" is indeed darker than its predecessors. This book isn't intended for five year olds, and I see no reason why good children's literature full of suspense, magic and a bit of thrill shouldn't be available. Thank goodness J.K. Rowling seems to agree. The regular cast of lovable characters are back, in the midst of pubescent angst, and dealing with an evil sorceror to boot. Harry's life is never dull.At 800 plus pages, this is one of the more involved children's books around, though the reading isn't difficult for young adults. I definitely would not recommend this book, or any in the series, to very young children as there are more advanced themes that many parents may not feel to be suitable. Obviously, informed parents would want to read the book first anyway.Harry, Ron, Hermione, Cho...all of them are growing up. The fact that their characters develop a broader emotional range is indicative of this fact. I certainly remember myself at 15. Everything that was good at all was absolutely wonderful, and anything not completely in my favor spelled the end of the world. In Harry's case, these extremes could very well be accurate, which is one of the reasons these books hold so much more magic than any wand from Olivander's could summon.J.K. Rowling's imagination runs wild, as it always does. Her warm sense of humor intertwines with sometimes scary subject matter and creates a truly unique story line. Hopefully, the wait for the next installment will be shorter. Hopefully, the attentive reader will realize that ""Order of the Phoenix"" is not a stand alone work, and that it needs to be measured, finally, by not only what came before it, but by what will come after it.",FALSE,2004,1873
"3950",5,731211,FALSE,"...the long-awaited end. It's gonna be bittersweet to see this series end, especially since we can never know if JK Rowling will give us a ""neat-and-tidy"" end or a ""twisted"" shocker of an end. That being said, Book V is another highly-crafted tome, with Rowling striving to reach epic proportions. I still remember the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and how it threw endless twists and situations at us in under 350 pages. No doubt that after the ""Goblet of Fire"" and its enormous pop culture impact, Rowling felt confident enough to stretch the new book to almost 900 pages, an enormous lenght for a ""kids"" book.This is another misconception: some people still call Harry Potter, essentially, a children's story/series. This couldn't be farther from the truth, especially with the last two books. After a character's death in the fourth and the abundance of Dark Arts talk (and actions) in this book, it'll be interesting to see how dark Rowling might make the next two books. How about the lenghts? Will the series keep getting longer until Book VII reaches ""War and Peace"" proportions?The book itself is another Rowling masterpiece, more confident in her prose and plotting, allowing the book to breathe and absorb the many people and places she puts in it (we visit for the first time the Ministry of Magic and St. Mungo's here). Harry, being fifteen years old, keeps maturing into a teenager over the timespan of the books: in this book he is almost always angry, scowling and bitter, just like a real teenager. He suffers the pangs of a crush and experiences the same confusion about girls as all boys his age do. I feel that is a really intergral and important part of this series, the maturing of the characters with their age. Try not to cry when Rowling kills off another much more important character. The duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort will look really cool in the movie, and the revelation about Harry is another piece of the puzzle. The seven books, once they are complete, will be a very rich tapestry of characters, events, and destinies intertwining. Another rich, enjoyable read, to tide us over for another three years before Book VI comes out. Can't wait!!",FALSE,2003,1490
"3952",5,731204,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book in the series, therefore is Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts, thus his age being 15. The Order of the Phoenix is a fattening (not to mention intimidating) 870 pages, and is over a hundred pages longer than the Goblet of Fire, which was long in its own right. The Order of the Phoenix starts out once again with Harry living at the Dursley's home on Privet Drive, though something very unordinary happens to Harry while he's heading home with Dudley one hot evening. Harry and his cousin are attacked by two Dementors (the guards of the Wizard Prison Azkaban), and after Harry uses magic to defend him and his cousin from them, a letter is sent almost instantaneously that Harry has been recommended for Expulsion from Hogwarts and is to attend a hearing later that month at the Ministry of Magic.Harry isn't expelled, but life going back to Hogwarts wasn't going to be any easier than it has been ever since his first year. In the ending events of the Goblet of Fire (minor spoilers for those who haven't read the fourth book), Lord Voldemort has returned to a physical form, and so an old anti-Voldemort group that had been disbanded when he lost all his power to Harry Potter when he was a baby, called the Order of the Phoenix, and was founded by none other than Albus Dumbledore. The Order is comprised of many familiar characters from Harry's past years at Hogwarts, such as Madeye Moody, Remus Lupin, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius Black, a real surprise Severus Snape (as much as you may think he's evil, he's certainly not), and of course Albus Dumbledore - while a couple new characters like Kingsley and Tonks are introduced to the series, which look to be some promising characters in future books.Going back to Hogwarts wasn't going to be as much fun as Harry was hoping it would be, though, because even though Harry had been face to face with Lord Voldemort not more than 2 months ago, the Minister of Magic's Cornelius Fudge would NOT believe that ""He-who-must-not-be-named"", and so the Daily Prophet was reporting non-stop at how Harry is just looking for fame, basically saying that he was LYING about Voldemort's return.The Order of the Phoenix is filled with all sorts of problems like Cornelius Fudge trying to take Albus Dumbledore out as Headmaster of Hogwarts, a continued search of Sirius Black even though he is innocent of the crime he was committed of (and served for), and a new witchlike lady sent in from the ministry as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge. Aside from Harry having weird dreams where he feels like he is actually there (which of course are used to build up the ending of the book), the Ministry of Magic is trying to take over Hogwarts and Professor Umbridge was appointed High Inquisitor, and overall makes Harry's life (along with teachers and other students) a living hell.The Order of the Phoenix does a great job at building up for THE best ending in any of the Harry Potter books yet, and I was more baffled about certain things in this than I was the first four books at all, almost twice as much. While many questions in the Order of the Phoenix were answered in an explanatory matter, many more questions also rose from the book, and so that gives the sense that the sixth book will have a great deal of explaining to do on things. Basically, the Order of the Phoenix builds up around to what ends up to be the best ending than in any of the other four books, and while keeping from giving any spoilers, I must say that the action and sense of urgency was a very fulfilling feeling.The Order of the Phoenix had a lot of directions that it could have gone in, since the first 3 books were leading up to what would be the resurrection of Lord Voldemort, though it took the definite route at a much more darker feel, and ultimately to the final battle of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Who knows though? As far as anyone knows (except for Rowlings of course), the seventh book could leave off before Harry and Voldemort even have a final bout, though sensing at how bad the tension between Voldemort and Harry was in the Order of the Phoenix, I doubt the series will leave off without their final duel.Thankfully, most of the characters from the past 4 Harry Potter books appear once again in the Order of the Phoenix at one time or another, while some new ones were also introduced. Dumbledore is of course back, as well as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, George, Sirius Black, Lupin, Mad Eye Moody, Lord Voldemort, Cornelius Fudge, and all the other Professors, while new characters to the series include Dolores Umbridge (you know that old hag of a teacher almost everyone has had one time or another in their lifetime?) and various members of Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters (his followers).I HIGHLY recommend reading through the first 4 books before starting this one. While each book is a ""story"" in its own entity, there is still a very strong connection between all of the books to where you can't just pick up and read in the middle and expect to understand anything. The books nature is also MUCH more dark as the previous books, and at certain points kind of matures into more adult themes, but it was kind of evident that that was where the series was going to have to start going. After all, Lord Voldemort isn't some cheese ball, he's a for sure killer and will stop at nothing to get to Harry.",FALSE,2003,1483
"3956",5,731181,FALSE,"NO SPOILERS:  As I just finished reading this book for the first time.  I have to say my fill. I suppose some people are disappointed and such, which is bound to happen in a series as popular as Harry Potter is, especially with people putting 'Million Mile High' expectations on something that is only a Muggle's creation.  As much as I love Harry Potter I would not write a good review if I hated it, and despite its length it held my interest from beginning to end, and I read it for 36hrs straight with no breaks, even for sleep or food.  Would I rate it the best in the series? Yes. Why you ask? Skeptical? The characters mainly, I was reduced to tears several times(Though maybe that was from lack-of-sleep! :p)  Yes, the books are flawed, but even JK Rowling said that every time she writes a book she herself believes it is dreadful and 'doesn't know why she's doing this because she's a terrible writer.'  As a fellow writer I do the EXACT SAME THING.  These books aren't dreadful, especially not this, the 5th installment of the series.  It is however, the darkest and most depressing thus far, as it deals with a Harry Potter who is very much torn between his role as a hero, and his role in Cedric Doggory's death.  All the characters have been fleshed out beyond expectations, giving them room to breath and live. I loved Harry and hated him (Quite often at the same time) in this novel. Solely because he reminds a lot of myself. I must be 3yrs behind in maturing as I am going through pretty much exactly what Harry is going through, or have all ready gone through it(With the exception of the death of parents and such.)  This was an important step for Harry to make to become the man he will eventually become.  If you look in the past books there's loads of stuff pointing to all he does.  This book sees him really taking up the role of a leader, and truly beginning to stand against evil on a daily basis and not just once a year over a few week period.  This book is where Harry really begins to grapple with who he really is, and what he should become.  Facing death yet again, and questioning why he even bothers fighting if everyone he loves has to die.  The thing that amazes me in this book particularly, is the detail that J.K. Rowling puts in to these books, and that everything is here for a purpose, not a word is wasted, no matter how mundane some of the material feels at times (especially the scenes with Cho Chang). You can see directly how the events of the books past directly effect the events in OotP and details that were previously unexplained become fleshed out.  It saddens me that 29% of the people on mugglenet.com are disapointed with this book.  I don't think J.K. could've done a better job and nobody else could have written it better(have you ever read HP fan fiction? Who knows the characters better?).  OotP is certainly the most difficult of all the books to read, but it also reveals so many mysteries that it grips on to you tight till the very end.  While one may not be fully satisfied in the way it was written, one can at least be satisfied with its answers, and the way it still leaves many questions to be answered for the last two books.  Yes, I am a Christain too, I love Jesus, but Harry can be used for teaching the gospel too. :D  So I just hope when you read these books, you enjoy them. And if you don't... Well I'm sorry.

"3957",5,731197,FALSE,"To say that the ""Harry Potter"" series has revolutionized the publishing industry would be an understatement.  Since the release of ""Goblet of Fire"" in 2000, children and adults alike have been wating with bated breath for the 5th book in the 7 part series to arrive.  In those intervening years, two movies based on the books came out, countless parodies have been released, Rowling put out two small ""Potterverse"" books about Quidditch and Magical Beasts, and reports of her having writers block drove fans mad.  Finally, the book was announced with great fanfare, certain passages were released to an eager public, and the book was marketed like crazy.  Of course, all they would have to do would be to announce a release date, but that wouldn't lend itself to so many interesting tie-ins.  With ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", publishing finally had a release that could outdraw a movie(and did, with the book trouncing ""Hulk"" in sales).  So the marketing worked.  Does the book?Happily, this installment is probably the best Harry Potter book yet, easily surpassing the previous best, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"".  The book is dark, moody, tragic, and full of teen angst, but it loses none of the appeal, as the magical world continues to unfold and new mysteries arise and challanges are faced.  Rowling starts strong with this book, perhaps realizing that in ""Goblet of Fire"" the opening act took too long to set up.  ""OOtP"" is not just longer in length, it is richer in story.  I can't think of a single passage that needed to go.  The characters that are new are all memorable, especially Luna ""Looney"" Lovegood, a 4th year Ravenclaw who's father publishes the Wizard equivalent to the Weekly World News, but who also holds some secrets of her own.  The most increbile creation in this chapter of the Saga is Delores Umbridge, a government flunky who is sent to Hogwarts to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts and, with the proding of the quite corrupt Ministry of Magic, begins to audit the school teachers in sucha draconian manner that she makes Joeseph McCarthy look like a kitten.  Umbridge is the first adult in teh wizarding world not asociated with the dark side that is actually an evil person.  She is petty, angry, incompetent, but powerful, and she is the first sign in Harry's life that the world outside Hogwarts is not a perfect place.This book is all about change and responsibility.  Well, all of these books are about responsibility on one level or another, so change and how young people adapt to their new perspectives on life is the main focus.  Harry is an angry 15 year old in this one, Hormones presumably raging, and he is not the perfect boy he had been before.  He comes off as a bit self-righteous and bitter, and lashes out at everyone.  Yet he is still essentially a good person, and over the course of the novel you sense maturity finally growing in Harry.  Hermione seems to have matured as well, much more patient with Ron and Harry than befoe, and Ron is also gaining self-confidence.Other characters are built up as well, especially Neville Longbottom, and the Weasley Twins, Fred & George, are written so perfectly that I swear I knew people just like them at that age.The guiding hand of the adults that shepperded Harry through the first 4 novels is noticably absent for much of the book.  Dumbledore is always around, but his actions remain a mystery through much of the book.  Hagrid is back, but in a much more limited role than ever before.  Snape takes on a larger role, but he's not much of a guide, and the adult with all the power, Umbridge, is not someone to be trusted.  Harry and his friends are now forced to act on their own, and Rowling stresses more than ever the need to trust in your friends and yourself, as well as the need to remain grounded in some sort of reality.  Harry learns a lesson about his own arrogance here that, I hate to say, he kinda had coming.  It's a very mature theme for a ""kids"" book, but this is fantasy, and fantasy is the realm of not just children but those who enjoy using their imaginations.JK Rowling is now securely placed near the top of fantasy literature, with fellow Brits CS Lewis an JRR Tolkien.  She has created a wonderful world and continues to add to it.  Her characters show real emotional growth, and the ""OOtP"" is easily her best work yet.  I hope it doesn't take 3 years for the next one, but if that's how long it takes for a book of this quality, I think I can wait.",FALSE,2003,1476
"3958",3,731203,FALSE,"This is something of an anticlimax after ""Goblet of Fire"". That ended along lines of:  Now Voldemort is back and the great conflict begins. Only it doesn't all that much. It doesn't, it would seem, begin in earnest, until the Ministry of Magic is convinced Voldemort  has returned and they still think it's all nonsense. This causes the Minister, Cornelius Fudge, to turn on Harry and his friends with a somewhat over-the-top ferocity, trying to have him expelled from Hogwarts on a specious charge and, that failing, installing his vindictive sidekick Dolores Umbridge at Hogwarts in the role of ""High Inquisitor"". And it is Harry's persecution by Umbridge that supplies the central thread of the story. Voldemort is still around and up to no good and of course takes centre-stage at the climax but his antics seem a more or less secondary plot line after the business with Umbridge and the Ministry.And Umbridge is a bit of a problem and a symptom of a wider one. Like Lucius Malfoy and his Slytherin gang and like the Dursleys, she is a rather crudely drawn uncomplicated baddie, in effect simply a pantomime villain, there for us to hiss at when she enters the stage. That's OK in a short simple children's story but in a book of this considerable length, we surely want characterization with more depth and complexity. As always, at the end of the book, various little mysteries are cleared up that will have intrigued the reader but don't hold your breath if, like me, you find yourself wondering, So, where is Umbridge coming from, what is her beef exactly, just why is it she is behaving like this? We really learn nothing to address this and are presumably meant to take the answer to be simply, Because she is very very bad. And that's disappointing. The big exception to the more general complaint is of course Snape, the most interesting and ambivalent of all the book's characters and it's good that he features prominently in this one, where, incidentally, we learn something about just what is driving his hostility towards Harry, just the kind of insight we look for with other characters and miss. It's a particular shame with the Dursleys perhaps as they are the only muggle characters and it would be nice if they were just a little less one-dimensional.So as someone who has enjoyed these books I was a little disappointed by this one.

"3960",5,731219,FALSE,"""The Order of the Phoenix"" is the best and most ""adult"" Harry Potter book yet.  At 870 pages, with the now-teenage characters drinking coffee and sometimes looking for something stronger, dating, falling into sullen moods, and suffering emotional as well as physical pain, this is clearly a book aimed at an older audience than ""The Sorcerer's Stone.""  The length and timing of the books seems to be a deliberate part of a plan for young people to grow with them.  By the time a ten year old is finished with ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" he or she could be eleven and ready for ""Chamber of Secrets.""  ""Phoenix"" is not only long enough to scare away an inappropriately young audience (it is probably too scary for young children), but it is dark and serious enough to engage teenagers...and older audiences (like me!).  The book is also more internally consistent than its predecessors, and the characters' motives are more accessible to adults.  For instance, the younger Potter seemed unaccountably distrustful of adults until I came to realize that children basically walk through life afraid of getting caught.  Almost anything a young child may have the urge to do is the type of thing adults put limits on.  So young Harry would not go to his elders when such a course seemed, from my adult perspective, to be the logical thing to do.  Harry must remain self-reliant, otherwise he wouldn't be at the center of the stories.  In Phoenix, he is either physically separated from some allied adults, or is resentful towards others.  Its not so much that he's distrustful as he is buffeted between forces that are affecting them too.  The hideous Dolores Umbridge, subjects other adults to the same type of police-state that the younger Harry must have felt like he was living in whenever he entered Professor Snape's classroom from the start.  Phoneix is the second book in which a significant character dies, which makes up for the overly happy endings of the first two books and enhances a genuine sense of suspense and foreboding as the book moves along.  And the book certainly does move along.  No long, boring descriptions of Quiddich, no tedious Winter Ball.  Just about every page moves the plot along.I spent the summer reading the Potter books, and this was a great one to end my run with.  I suppose it may be a few summers yet before the sixth book comes out.  ""Phoneix""  leaves me eagerly anticipating that date.",FALSE,2003,1498
"3962",5,730781,FALSE,"With this installment, author J.K. Rowling chronicles the third year of Harry Potter's time at the Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft.  This one sets forth an intruiging mystery - The evil Sirius Black, henchman of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort (also known as He-who-must-not-be-named) has escaped from the Alcatraz-like prison fortress of Azkaban and is apparently intent on finding and killing young Harry Potter as part of a plan to restore Lord Voldemort to power.  The wizarding world is determined to find Black and send him back to prison, while protecting Harry by any means necessary.  Unfortunately, this includes sending out the enforcers known as Dementors, who are sinister creatures who strike fear into the hearts of all who see them, especially Harry, who faints at the mere sight of them.  Of course, as with the first two books in the series, nothing is as it seems, and Harry and his friends are drawn into another adventure as they attempt to get through the school year.All the continuing characters from Harry's previous adventures return here, including his good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, the Care-of-Magical-Creatures teacher Hagrid with yet another brood of wild and wooly creatures for the students to learn about, Headmaster Dumbledore, Professors McGonagall and Snape, the nasty Dursley family, and of course, Harry's annoying rival, Draco Malfoy.  In addition, this book provides a healthy dose of Quidditch matches, as Gryffindor House once again attempts to win the yearly competition with the other houses.  Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor house team, is in his last year at Hogwarts, so he is STRONGLY motivated to win this time.There are also several new characters introduced, including the aforementioned Sirius Black, and Professor Lupin, who is the latest in an ongoing string of Defense-Against-The-Dark-Arts professors.The book is a very enjoyable read, better than the first two (which were both still very good).  Harry picks up some more magic skills, refines his Quidditch playing, and learns more about his parents and the manner of their death.  I have a feeling that as this series progresses, we will continue to get more and more familiar with Harry's (supposedly?) dead family.Of course, as with the other books, Harry goes through the year trying to get through classes, while also breaking the occasional rule with the help of Ron Weasley and his mischevious older twin brothers.  The Hogwarts student body continues to be fleshed out in this book, as we get to know more and more of the other students there besides Harry, Ron, and Hermione.Overall, an excellent read.  These books continue to improve.  I look forward to reading The Goblet of Fire.",FALSE,2002,1060

Harry has not heard much from his friends Ron and Hermione, Ron's father won some gold over the holidays and took the whole family to visit Ron's eldest brother in Egypt, scabbers went too; Hermione went to France with her parents on holiday.Harry was having breakfast with the Dursleys one morning, the TV was on and in the background there was a report of a dangerous criminal, Sirius Black, escaping from prison and a letter arrived informing the family of a visit from Mr. Dursleys sister, an obnoxious women who had always shown a particular dislike of Harry.Harry is looking forward to his third year at school, in this year students are allowed to occasionally visit the village of Hogsmeade, which is completely inhabited by witches, wizards and other magical creatures, but Harry needs his Uncle to sign the consent form to allow him to go out of school. Harry tries very hard to merge into the background and not upset anyone in the hope of getting his consent form signed.Mr. Dursleys sisters visit is just too much of a strain for Harry and eventually things come to a head resulting in Harry running away late at night and without his consent form signed. A huge black dog, which causes him to fall, frightens Harry and he is nearly run over by the knight bus (a magical bus that takes you anywhere). Harry becomes a passenger on the knight bus and disembarks at Diagon Alley where he books into a room at the Leaky Cauldron until it is time to return to school.The Weasleys and Hermione spend the last night of the holidays at the Leaky Cauldron with Harry and Harry overhears a conversation about him being in danger, it seems the escaped convict Sirius Black was in league with Voldermart and has returned to kill Harry.The school is guarded by Dementors, hideous creatures who drain all happy thoughts out of people they come into contact with leaving them with the thoughts of the worst thing that has ever happened to them, while in the Dementors presence, they are the grim guards of Azkaban prison.Harry has another year of adventures; using a secret map given to him by the Weasley twins he discovers underground tunnels and a secret way into the village of Hogsmeade. Problems arise between the three friends, Hermione has bought herself a pet cat she calls crookshanks who takes a real dislike to Ron's rat scabbers, this causes bad feelings between Hermione and Ron with Harry stuck in the middle. The year is again full of danger, excitement and adventure with twists and turns and the bad guy turns out to be the last person you would expect.

"3964",5,731206,FALSE,"I devoured this book in less than a week, and twice rented movies to distract myself because I wanted that first-time reading experience to last a little longer. (For the record, I'm 45, and ""The Nazi Officer's Wife"" was the book I read immediately before Phoenix.)I mourned the ending of the book, not only for the growth experiences that cause Harry pain, but also because reading this book was such an extremely satisfying experience. The first four books were entertaining and fun.  Phoenix, in turn, is complex, not always fun, but acutely insightful.  Harry is a remarkable portrait of adolescence, and I saw myself thirty years ago in his uncontrolled rages followed by remorse, his personal over-awareness, and his increasingly complicated but also ultimately more satisfying relationships with peers and family.  Harry also learns that the world is more nuanced and less clearcut.  And the very nature of good and evil are examined over and over again, with no concessions to the world of absolutes and easy answers.And yet much about Phoenix is pleasantly familiar and comfortable. The story slowly builds for the first two hundred pages and then rolls along easily toward the finish. Rowling's cartography and dialect create intimate and absorbing settings, and she introduces several new locales.  Hermione and Ron continue to be enjoyable, even as Ron learns to cut Harry some slack and Hermione chills out a bit.  Rowling's worlds--both magical and Muggle--continue to be intriguingly free of most modern distractions (one punkish character with bright blue hair appears oddly anachronistic, given the overall 1950s ambience), and amusingly evocative of classic literary references to magic: students wear robes, carry wooden wands, and quaff pumpkin juice; owls, not e-mail, deliver letters; and the only worms are the ones encountered in classes about strange animals. Freeing the background from modern complexities has the same effect Austen strived for when she made Emma wealthy: by eliminating a major confounding factor, the story concentrates more fully on universal emotional and moral (and literary) issues.The denouement was less surprising than I anticipated, but a fitting conclusion to the story's development.  The only question I had was whether I would see shadows of my 16-year-old self in the next book.",FALSE,2003,1485
"3965",5,731511,FALSE,"I'm sure all have seen and read the plot statements, so I won't describe them here. I've seen some reviews that claim that the books are boring, or repetitive or something like that. I'm not quite sure what these reviewers were expecting.I had heard about Harry Potter before, but I thought it was all hype, until I had the opportunity to read them for myself. I started to read the first book just to see what it was like, and I was hooked after 10 pages; I read all of the other books at that time (up to book 4) within a week. These books are chronicling a development in the wizarding world of Harry Potter just as much as they're chronicling the life of Harry Potter himself. They are supposed to get darker, if logic is to be followed. How can you have something ""light and fluffy"" and expect it to be gripping? All the tension that is begun at the end of book 4 is wonderfully continued here in book 5, and Ms. Rowling's portrayal of Harry as a flawed (ergo realistic) person is quite well done. It makes you feel angry with, as well as sorry for and proud of Harry, and leaves you waiting with bated breath for the next volumes.This series doesn't hold back with the drama and is as realistic as one could imagine fantasy to be. Sure, I get annoyed at some obvious caraciatures (how in blazes can Draco Malfoy be such a bloody GIT??? You'd think he'd realize how old his act gets!) but Harry Potter will never go away. I'm just sad that Ms. Rowling says that book #7 will be the last one ever.P.S. I had originally ranked #3 as the best after #5, but after re-reading #4, i put it on equal tier with #3. Books 1 and 2 are more ""stand-alone"" to me. I'd compare the Harry Potter series to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Both ran for 7 seasons (series), and both had a continuing story arc beginning in season/book 3 (the beginning of the Dominion conflict in DS9, the escape of Wormtail and Sirus in ""Azkhaban"") which grew to the final climax in season/books 7.",FALSE,2004,1790
"3966",5,730466,FALSE,"This third volume is packed with magic and suspense. It starts dramatically from the very beginning. Harry Potter is chased in all possible ways and he will finally discover the truth about his father and mother, about their death, about who the traitor was, about who the victims were. New dimensions of the magic world will appear and the book develops a wide side of horror. The main characters in this new dimension are the Askaban prison wardens, the Dementors. But this book also develops the vision of the magic world from a political point of view. We deal with its government, and especially with the fake justice that reigns there, a justice that takes decisions under the pressure of some bullying VIPs who frighten those who have to take decisions. And we find out that there is no way to escape that fake justice, except if some wiser people decide to go against it in the wings and deprive this blind system, and justice is blind as blind can be, of its preys by cheating with the system, and, there, only magic enables such cheating. In other words, it is a criticism of normal society that works the same way, whose justice is just as blind as here, but in the real world there is no magic, hence there is constant miscarriage of justice that cannot be prevented nor repaired. This book is thus becoming a critical metaphor of the real world. The book is also interesting because we follow the heroes in their growth, one year after another and the author is marvellously able to make them grow under our eyes. They are children, but they become more and more mature with each volume. So far they are young enough to grow in maturity only in the field of their intellectual and social awareness and responsibility, in the field of their social, ethical and cultural principles. They discover injustice and are repulsed by it. They discover hate and they are both dejected and disgusted by it. The main asset of the book remains that the world we are discovering is a real world, with human feelings, with families, with a social and economic organization, etc. It is not a parody of the real world, at the most a metaphor of it, but it is a fully developed world with fully human characters, even if they are wizards and witches, even werewolves. And this particular trait shows us how racist a society can be that rejects those who are different because they are different and are seen as dangerous, though they can be dealt with in a humane way and helped to be totally inoffensive, their particular qualities becoming assets for everyone.

"3968",5,731192,FALSE,"J. K. Rowling continues to spin her magic in the fifth Harry Potter book in the series.  The book opens with Harry once again enduring his summer holidays at the Dursleys.  Forced to illegally use magic in the presence of his cousin, Dudley, to fend of an attack from Dementors, Harry becomes the subject of a hearing by the Ministry of Magic.  He faces possible expulsion from Hogwarts and a lifetime ban from using magic.  Dumbledore comes to his rescue, of course, and Harry escapes expulsion, but the coming year at Hogwarts turns out to be Harry's toughest yet.  His reputation amongst Hogwarts students is in tatters due to a Ministry-led smear campaign - the full story of how Cedric Diggory died in the Triwizard contest was never told, and Cornelius Fudge steadfastly refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned.  Harry also faces the prospect of a heavy workload in preparation for the O.W.L.s exams, which is not helped by the fact that the dastardly new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher, who is also the Ministry-appointed High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, constantly puts him in detention.  Harry's crush on rival Seeker, Cho Chang, is not helped by her confusing emotions towards him and the dead Cedric Diggory.  Harry's scar is also constantly painful whenever Voldemort has a particularly strong emotion, and his sleep is often interrupted by visions of Voldemort's thoughts.  Further, Dumbledore distances himself from Harry, believing Voldemort could use Harry to attack him through the mental link that Harry and Voldemort share.  Fortunately, Harry has a group of loyal friends to help him overcome these problems and more - Hermione helps to explain the intricacies of girls' emotions to the clueless Harry and Ron, Ron's sister Ginny grows up to be both wise and brave, and Harry gains a new ally in the apparently air-headed but mysterious Luna Lovegood.  Most surprisingly, Neville Longbottom blossoms from being forgetful and timid to being loyal and brave enough to face almost certain death - a worthy son to his ex-Auror parents.

I used to read all sorts of books when I was young (if Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys sound familiar to you, then you'll know roughly how old I am).  I read whatever I could get a hold of and it filled me with a sense of wonder and imagination.  Reading filled voids during the lonely times, and gave me something to think about during the happy times.It's kind of ironic that a children's book should make me fall in love with reading again.  But this book did the trick.  From Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I slowly read the next book in the series, then the next and the next.

Then I saw the movie trailer for The Bourne Identity which stars Matt Damon and I looked for the book it was based on.  That led me to explore the world of espionage and international conspiracies according to Robert Ludlum.  From here, I realized that I should probably balance my reading between fiction and non-fiction.  So I read Good to Great, a business book by Jim Collins (the author of Built to Last), Jack: Straight from the Gut (about Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE), Made in America (about Sam Walton...).

I've read current books by John Grisham, Jonathan Kellerman, Sandra Brown, Carol Higgins Clark, Robin Cook, Tess Gerritsen, and many many more.

All this in a span of 5 months.I don't even realize how caught up I get when I describe to my friends the books I've read and the books I plan to read.

The dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, has returned to power and continues to gather his followers for a second war in the wizarding world. Meanwhile, Harry is haunted with the same dreams over and over. He's sure that they must mean something important. Harry is also beginning adolescence and is trying to deal with everything that it entails (at least, as much as the famous boy wizard can do).At school, the Ministry Of Magic is trying to take over and has positioned one of its own as the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher. Consistently antagonizing the headmaster, Dulmbledore, the Ministry refuses to believe his or Harry's story about the return of Lord Voldemort. So, it's up to them and a small group of wizards called The Order Of The Phoenix to shine the light of truth on the wizarding world while at the same time try to stop whatever plans Voldemort is concocting.Although not my favorite Harry Potter book, it's still a great read. The first half of the book is rather tedious, though. Harry, in the middle of adolescence, is constantly in a ""sulking"" mood and yelling at everyone he comes into contact with. Personally, I see enough pre-teens whining all of the time about how no one understands them and how they never get what they want. I don't need to read it in a story as well.

Especially memorable are the Dementors, who suck all happy thoughts from a person, driving him/her insane.  There are many more memorable additions to the Hogwarts universe that I won't go into as they would reveal too much of the plot.  Suffice to say, this is a page turner because you never know what's coming next (except we're pretty confident Harry will survive since there are 2 more H.P. books out there!).Adults are likely to notice that the tone and pacing are essentially identical to the previous book - I'm sure the target age-group would not notice, but as an adult I was hoping for a little more variety.  Likewise, there are times (especially with Snape and Malfoy) where they act like carricatures of comic book supervillians, and so are difficult to take seriously.  Again, the target 10-13 year old age group will likely not be concerned with this.  All in all, it is a rousing adventure that ""kids"" of all ages will enjoy, be they 10 or 50 years old.",FALSE,2003,1474
"3983",3,731501,FALSE,"After The Goblet of Fire expanded the world of Harry Potter and left us hanging on the point of Wizard War, with the greatest force of evil recently unleashed and characters setting off on quests all around the world, I was ready for the adventure of a lifetime- one with great scope, big changes, and stunning scenes.Instead, it's another scooby-doo adventure that doesnt stretch far beyond the boundaries of Hogwarts. Now these kinds of mystery adventures at Hogwarts were great in the first few books, but when the most powerful dark wizard in the world is loose and has assembled most of his dark wizards, you'd think they'd do more. But nothing happens....And once again, everyone at Hogwarts is so brutally cruel to Harry that I'm surprised he doesnt just off himself. Once again, all the students hate him and he has to prove himself. Again. Tiring! Even Dumbledore is awful to him, without a really valid reason. The entire staff at Hogwarts seems blind to the rampant cruelty in the school and makes no effort to stop it. I came to like Harry so much after the first four books, I really cant stand to see him so continually abused. If this happens in the next book, I'm going to skip it.The main baddie, Prof Umbridge, is so absolutely foul that no ending could satisfy the reader, and in fact the one in this book comes quite far from doing so.But on the good side, you see Harry with a temper, resisting authority (more than usual), and these are good moves in character development.Overall it's not bad, but I hope JK Rowling goes back in the direction of expanding Harry Potter's world and making the dark wizards a real continuing threat.

But there's one important thing i wanna tell adult audiences or christians who're skeptical about giving our Harry a go - and i know some of both these sorts.Adults - i urge you, this is NOT a kid's book! Well, it is, but its not JUST that. Firstly, its all-story. If you hate reading the kind of labourious over-thought trying-too-hard novels, if you ever want to just put your feet up and have fun after a hard day of work, or if you want to remember what it felt like to be young - HARRY HARRY HARRY! My little sisters finally convinced me to try Harry for myself after i'd finished high school, all the gruelling leaving exams we have here in Australia - and oh my god! It was the best thing i ever did. Harry Potter reminded me that books could be fun - that they were supposed to be entertaining. Rowling has done an amazing thing - she's found a voice and vocabulary that people of literally all age groups can get into and love. I tip my hat to her ceaselessly.Christians - the most important thing for you guys to do is lighten up. Harry is about fun. If anything, Harry reasserts your rigid ideas of good and evil. Witchcraft is not real - hate to break it to you! Its a fantasy novel, and its immensely fun!Lastly, just because the pope tells you not to read something - watchu gonna do - believe him? Believe everything the pope says? Damn it - give Harry a go yourself. Try him out - and judge for yourself. If you're going to be religious, at least have the courage to form your own opinions about non-Biblical things.I just wanna say - Hi Harry from Australia - the place where Dorothy's fantasies are real! We love you down here, Harry - and Ron! You legends!Oh, and finally - don't be put off by the kids school play acting of the movies - the books are the best - if you didn't read Harry before the movies came out you won't be able to help picturing Daniel, Rupert and Emma as the three young wizards, but that won't hurt.

"3986",5,731194,FALSE,"As a single girl with no kids- I have not been swept up in the Harry Potter craze,but i am a fan of the book as adult contemporary literature. It is worth reading. The Harry potter series is marketed as a kids book, but I know that alot of adults enjoy it with their children.  I hope that more and more adults will give this remarkable story a try- it has alot of grown up themes.  Like the other books, this fifth installment starts out with Harry Potter's summer with his muggle family.  This allows us to cover his whole year at Hogwarts and ends with him leaving for the summer at years end.  This year is quite different for Harry- he is ostrasized from the kids (who think he's crazy); from Dumbledorf (for reasons to be explained); and even from his best friends (who are now prefects).  No one believes him about the return of Voldemort and Harry and the Order of the Phoenix are battling the dark forces- not knowing who is on their side or who can be trusted.  This book is filled with darker images which is more appropriate as Harry grows older and is faced with difficult challenges and choices.  There are also more adult subplots-harry's adolescent romance, losing loved ones and even racial differences (muggles vs wizards, house elfs, pure bloods vs. those that are not pure etc)- it is quite an adult theme to deal with especially in these times.  I was happy that the author's writing style is also more sophisticated than in her previous novel, and the length of the book was not intimidating once you start to read it.  Each book can be read as a stand alone, but this book did not give the typical summary of past events so readers will get more enjoyment having read the previous 4.  All in all, I encourage adults and kids alike to pick up this amazing story and be transported into another world.  Besides, anything that makes kids start reading, has to be good!",FALSE,2003,1473
"3987",5,731182,FALSE,"Rowling continues her streak of great story-telling in The Order of the Phoenix.  As with all the books (in a series aimed at kids, continuity is good), the book begins in the summer with Harry at his uncle's and aunt's house being terminated by them and their son, Harry's cousin Dudley.  This book lingers a bit more on Harry's life during the summer, but eventually, he arrives back at Hogwarts and, as always, spends the year trying to learn about wizarding while going through agonies over Quidditch and trying to uncover and thwart the plots of Lord Voldemort and his allies.Since this book is the longest of the series so far, Rowling goes through the story leisurely.  Except for a scene early on, the action of the book does not start until midway through the book.  Instead, we are treated to a lot of character building.  Harry is going through the difficulties of a teenager.  He doesn't always trust his friends, Ron and Hermione.  He doesn't always trust his mentor, Dumbledore.  And he is having real trouble sorting out how to deal with girls that he likes.I had one minor problem with the book.  We also learn a lot about the wizard political world.  Wizard politics are prominent in this book because the wizard government appoints someone to look over Dumbledore's shoulder at Hogwarts, and this supplies much of the plot of the book.  Unfortunately, I think that Rowling made a wrong turn here.  I am not that interested in the political issues of the wizard world (in the same way that I am not interested in the political issues of the Jedi world in the Star Wars prequels).But Rowling's story-telling ability is so good, her continuing deepening of Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's character is so interesting, and the climax of the book is so much fun--leaving us hungry for the next book--that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still deserves five stars.",FALSE,2003,1461
"3988",4,731191,FALSE,"Let me just say that I really did enjoy this book.  I spent the weekend doing little else but reading this 870 tome and loved every minute.  There were some people complaining about the length of this book, saying that much like the previous Potter book.  I do not believe that shorting the story would have made it better in any way, shape or form.  I enjoy the way Rowling slips in jokes and sub-plots to the main story.  The characters all breathe and they all behave as if they have a unique history and lives outside of these pages.  The students and teachers are continuously true to life and you end up either caring deeply for them or hating them passionately.  Her writing creates a rich image of the strange and wonderful world of magic her characters dwell in.That said there is much to love in this book.  Two new characters are introduced, Luna Lovegood a slightly strange girl from Ravenclaw and the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Umbridge.  Professor Umbridge is a wonderful person to hate and Rowling does not spare any ink making we do hate her.  Harry is definitely growing up and it is a painful experience for himself and for those around him as well.  Gone is the sense of wonder about the magical world and in its place anger, frustration and resentment.I was pleased to Rowling expand a few minor characters, particularly Jenny Weesly and Nevil Longbottom.  She works hard to flesh these characters out and giving them a larger roles and to play in the story line.  I will confess I am a fan of Longbottom, while I usually don't admit to it, I was very much like him at that age.That said I must also say that this is, in my opinion, the weakest book in her series.There is very little new in the way of magic or the lifestyle of the inhabitants of Rowling's world until the end during the climactic fight scene, however the objects and ideas there are merely there as backdrops and their workings left unexplained or even well explored.  Also missing was much of the sense of fun and adventure.  I realize this is becoming an increasingly serious story line I do miss the sense of fun the first four books presented.All through the book I had the continuing feeling I had read this book before.The story formula has remained unchanged since the first book, the plot reads out the same in each book and to tell the truth it is getting a bit threadbare.  Harry potter is abused/neglected by his boorish non-magical relatives the Dursleys.  Harry thinks that his friends have abandoned him to this fate for the summer and feels sorry form himself.  A rescue from said boorish relatives by members of the magical community springs Harry to a more pleasant summer vacation.  Harry goes off to school where he is immediately branded an outcast by his fellow students.  Rumors about Harry being either mentally unsound or actively destructive abound.  Only Harry's two best friends, Ron and Hermione, continue to accept and understand him.  Harry worries about quidditch.  Harry falls behind in his school work.  Draco Malfoy works hard to make Harry's life miserable.  One of the Professors at school has it in for Harry.  There is an elaborate plot by Lord Valdemort and both Harry and his school are in danger.  The teachers at Harry's school could solve a lot of Harry's problems if they would just have an honest talk with him but they choose to remain silent.  Harry and company could resolve their problems if they would just have an honest talk with their teachers but they choose not to.  Harry and his friends go off to defeat Lord Voldemort and save the day.  A pitched battle with Lord Voldemort takes place and Harry comes close to loosing but doesn't.  The Schools Headmaster takes Harry aside and explains things to Harry.  Everyone at school loves Harry and feels very bad they mistrusted him.Rowling let it be known early on that one of the main characters will die in this book.  While I will not reveal just who does die I will admit my guess was incorrect.  Rowling does a rather good job in giving false clues to this event throughout the story.  I remember vividly reading the death of Cedric Diggory  the 4th book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and feeling a great deal of shock and anger and surprise.  Given the fact that Cedric had played a rather small part in the Goblet of Fire and I believe was only briefly mentioned in an earlier book I was hit rather hard by his death.  This time when the foretold death occurred I felt no real emotion about it.  Despite the fact it was a major character I really didn't feel very bad about it.  The death happen late in the book and I am not sure why it needed to be included at all.  The death of Cedric marked an end to the innocence of the series and prompted many questions about morality and Harry's part in Cedrick's death but this latest death seems to be there simply to remind people that characters in this world can and do die.I highly recommend the Order of the Phoenix and will likely reread it again soon but I hope Rowling pulls out fresher material for the next installment.",FALSE,2003,1470
"3989",5,731193,FALSE,"At the age of 31 I did not think I would be standing in line to buy a book at midnight. But I did and man, was it worth it.By now it is obvious for anyone who has read first four books, just how amazing they are. And of course all of us expected this book to continue the tradition. The Order of the Phoenix exceeded all expectations I had. IT IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.  What a story, what a story telling. How proud must J.K. Rowling feel to have written such extraordinary books.From a very first chapter (which as usual begins at Number 4 Privet Drive and this time we are given an explanation why Harry has to be there every summer), everything is set into motion with an attack on Harry and keeps going without a pause. I was surprised at myself that I managed to make this book last for four days (unlike the fourth book which I read in one day). Several times I found myself holding my breath and waiving my hands as if I had the wand in my hand. But what was so surprising to me (a very pleasant surprise at that) was the amount of emotions incorporated in the latest chapter. I moved from feeling anger to sadness to happiness to laughter to shock all throughout the book. And as hard as it may be for me admit the following, I was heartbroken by the end of the book. I cannot give out any details of the book without spoiling it for you. Everyone will have to find out for themselves. What I can tell you though is that most of the important characters from previous books have returned joined with few new ones, some of which you will love and some you will hate.The tone for the book 6 has been set. I just hope it will be printed sooner then later. The entire buzz you've heard about this book breaking all the sales records of any other book are true and very well deserved.

"3991",5,731248,FALSE,"Before I get to the heart of my review let me just say this. I will be the first to admit  that the OP is the longest  of the five so far. And I'm sure that the story could have been edited down to say 300-400 pages. On the other hand, there would be so many aspects of the book that we would miss. There are many subplots that all work together.  My other comment is that many review s blast this book for its predictability...  And it is. That is the whole idea of the series the battle of good over evil. Now with that said I'll give you a review.I'm a huge fan of the books. And, the OP is no exception.  JKR's use of mythology and myths is the beauty of this, and the rest of the books. This OP we find Harry going under a transition.  With not hearing from his friends Ron and Hermione, Harry starts getting the idea that either something has happened to them or that the ""Chamber of Secrets"" scenario in that Dobby is holding letters from him.  On top of that Harry is finally hitting his growing pains. He does lose his temper quite often. We also learn how the death of Cedric still haunts Harry.  Yet the one thing that took me by surprise Petunia knows more about the magic world then we previous thought.The story is tight.  As we have find out the book  like Harry,  is full of transitions.  Both in tone and in Harry. The one thing that notice is when Umbridge , takes over the school, it reminds me of Orwell's ""Animal Farm."" Only in terms of how a small few hold and control every aspect of the school, which parallel to the farm. In this book again Harry must deal with death.  This time it is the death of a person whom is loves and cares deeply for.The idea of trust also plays well into the story, this referring to Dumbledore's Army and with the Prefects. One idea that plays well in the book is the idea of power and control which is countered by love and inner strength.  Power and control coming from the information that the Ministry of Magic has over the media, The Daily Prophet also with in the school and how Umbridge tries to ""suppress"" free thinking and gaining information.  One more example of this is the division between Percy and the rest of the Weasley's. Love and inner strength coming from Harry going out on a date with Cho and even though Harry does get very angry at various people what he learns in the by the end of book will have your head spinning. I had to reread the book twice and a couple of chapters to fully grasp what I was reading. Not that it was hard, but just what we find out.This book is truly setting us up for last two books. In some ways the story is secondary to what new information we learn.  At the same time we can make a couple of assumptions, like Aberforth Dumbledore may be the bartender at the Hog's Head Inn in Hogsmeade.  I don't want to get too much away.Over all this is the best so far in what we find out about the wizard world and Harry's history and another boy's possible history.

"3992",5,731193,FALSE,"Fans of the Harry Potter series will not be disappointed by this AMAZING installment. At least, this 14 year old fan wasn't.Even with its gargantuan length, the book never gets dull. When the plot isn't roaring along at a fantastic and breakneck pace, we're left with great character development that gives us insight into the lives of some lesser characters (like Mrs. Weasley and Neville). Or some funny lines from Fred and George. Or more of what makes these books so great. The chemistry and the bond between the characters.The book begins at Number 4 Privet Drive - where Harry is having a horrible summer. But one hot night, Dementors show up and suddenly Harry finds himself caught up in a giant misunderstanding (or is it) leaving him in danger of being expelled from Hogwarts!But the book continues on and in a twist sure to leave readers outraged, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge turns out to be a completely evil piece of work bent on destroying everything about Hogwarts that Harry and his friends love so much - with special powers from the Cornelius Fudge, the delusional Minister of Magic who believes Dumbledore is out to get him and will stop at nothing to ""reform"" the school and get his own way.Meanwhile, Hagrid is missing and nothing is turning out the way it should be. As you can probably guess, the action doesn't stop there.Two things I did not like were the death scene everyone's been talking about (a big disappointment, I felt it was anticlimatic and not dramatic at all and not as good as I expected) and the scene where Dumbledore reveals ""the truth"" to Harry. The truth turned out to be something very obvious that most people probably already guessed by now - not a huge secret worthy of being on the back page.There seem to be some small discrepancies in the story, but they will probably be explained later and do not have a large impact on the story.But it's still worthwhile, and I have to agree Harry Potter is worthy of all the hype.",FALSE,2003,1472
"3993",5,731188,FALSE,"Man, am I ever relieved that this book wasn't as wildly hyped over the media as book four--it makes it easier to relax with and dive into this time.Far be it from me to go into details concerning the actual story, I'll just say a couple of notes about it while also adding that it's a fun book:(1) I'm so relieved that Rowling didn't insist on doing an ""intro recap""ping all over again with this book the way she spent each ""chapter one"" in all the previous four titles. You know, explaining who Harry was, why he's so important, his background, etc. I guess she realizes by now that it's no longer necessary since everybody's either already heard of it all by word of mouth, or by the media or has already read the other novels. By this point the only folks who DON'T know about Harry's entire situation, whether they love or hate the series, are those living under a rock or on the moon for the past several years. So this time, she simply cuts right to the chase. Bravo.(2) Harry starts this book off EXTREMELY ticked; all the pressures and annoyances we've read about in the other books are finally testing his patience. It's a relief to see him become more and more believable as time goes by, as by this point I've be pretty frayed, outraged and disgusted by the whole lot myself.(3) I won't go into exactly how the book begins, I'll just say that the series had been seriously threatening to get into a rut with a specific sort of story setup that would repeat itself with each book before Harry made his way to Hogwarts (regular readers already know what I mean), although that pattern began to finally show *some* signs of changing with book four. This time, we *FINALLY* get a completely different launch that begins to get down to the meat of matters and addresses underlying tensions, not to mention unanswered questions and denials. Excellent.and(4) I've had my ""phoenix"" suspicions for a long, long time now. Fascinating to see I was accurate after taking today to devour this one.Superb, Rowling! :)",FALSE,2003,1467
"3995",5,731190,FALSE,"In the 3 years between the publication of the fourth book (""The Goblet of Fire"") in JK Rowling's series of seven and this book, the whole phenomena that is Harry Potter has truly gone stratospheric.  Aided and abetted by the movies of the first two books, a truly bewildering amount of merchandising and ongoing controversy from religious groups, parents groups and literature critics, has there ever been a book as anticipated as this one? Can such expectations ever be fulfilled or are we destined to be disappointed?""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the story of Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and is much wider in its scope and ambition than any of the four that preceded it.  As Harry grows from childhood into adolescence, the complexity of both Harry's internal would and the world around him is increasing and his confusion at this constent flux is reassuringly familiar for the adult or teenage reader, Ms Rowling has not fallen into the trap of trying to keep her hero a child forever and the story benefits immeasurably because of it.A word of warning folks, although this book certainly stands on it's own merit and can be read just for itself; more than any other of the Harry Potter books, this one needs to be read in the context of an unfolding story, so if you haven't read the first four then this is not the best place to start.  You'll enjoy it, but many of the subtleties of the tale could be lost on you.  This is not a criticism of the story, but rather a reflection of its place as a genuine continuation of a narrative rather than a spin off sequel.As regular readers of the series will know, Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort has managed to regain his body and is currently gathering his forces and drawing his plans.  ""The Order of the Phoenix"" mentioned in the title of the novel is the group of witches and wizards assembled by Dumbledore to resist Voldemort and halt his rise.  But the Wizarding world is divided, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, resolutely refuses to accept the fact of Voldemort's rebirth, preferring instead to think that Dumbledore is spreading lies and attempting to build a private army in order to make himself Minister for Magic.  These events could hardly be expected to have no effect on Harry, but this is his exam year and as events are unfolding beyond his control and those closest to him seem to be oblivious or at least unsympathetic to his feelings, his sense of isolation and frustration and his feelings of being misunderstood, excluded and patronised are wonderfully realised, tinged with a genuine feeling that the author has been here and is intimately familiar with its craggy landscape.Ms Rowling did say outright far in advance of the publication of this novel that the new defence against the dark arts teacher would be a woman; this is delivered in the character of ""Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic"", Dolores Umbridge.  Singularly unattractive, Umbridge is one of the most despicable characters yet seen in this series (and lets fact it considering that this includes the Malfoy's, Wormtail, Barty Crouch and of course the Dark Lord himself, she's up against some serious competition), bigoted, myopic, vindictive and at times downright sadistic, she is used in the context of the story not only to torment the staff and students in her capacity as high inquisitor for Hogwarts, but to explore themes of prejudice and arrogance.So am I disappointed?  Well, No actually, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has all the depth, wit and subtlety that its avid readers have come to expect from the Harry Potter series.  What we are presented with here is a richly textured narrative containing a twist worthy of ""The Usual Suspects"" if someone hasn't already told you.  If you didn't like the other novel's in the series, then chances are that you'll not like this one either, but for those of us who did JK Rowling has presented us with another gem which takes the story of the boy who lived to a whole new level.  But is it literature?  Well on that point I'll confine myself to remarking that a person of what ever age who fails to extract some pleasure from JK Rowling's work must have had the joy of living stamped out of them at an early age in a manner that even the late and unlamented Thomas Gradgrind would fine intolerable.  Roll on book six!!!",FALSE,2003,1469
"3996",4,731191,FALSE,"The following review, while not containing spoilers, still has some information about the book that was released  to the press before it's publication, so keep that in mind as you continue to read:I have been a Harry Potter fan ever since the first book was read to me by my teacher in 5th grade. Since then I have found each book better than the last, and I especially anticipated this book because it would be technically sophomore year, which I just completed. So, now that I have finished The Order of the Phoenix, let me start by saying that Rowling did a superb job capturing the essence of a 15 year old without making it too dirty...; the hormones, the emotions, the misunderstanding were all presented well. On that note though, I found this book to be dramatically different from the others, some good, some bad. Some of it I expected, as I knew after reading the Goblet of Fire that everything in this book would be set around the idea that Voldemort has fully returned and the Ministry of Magic (the wizard gov't) would be trying to suppress the idea. I also knew a big part of the school year would be based around O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) which, in the real world, could kind of be thought of as SAT's or PSAT's (since it's sophomore year). These indeed were true. The basic progression of the story nevertheless did remain the same as the other stories--home with the Dursley's, something unexpected, new dark arts teacher, some encompassing theme during the year, a difficult task involving Voldemort, and finally the explanation where the many of the questions raised in the book are answered. Still, after reading it, I am definitely left with a different feeling than I was after completing the other books, possibly because the task at the end relating to Voldemort, was rather self-imposed by Harry, and in a sense makes him out to seem as he had been stereotyped: fame-hungry and just wanting to be a hero. Still, one rather disturbing elements of this story was the mistakes made by Dumbledore, which does layer him more as a character, but in such a way that I personally would have rather not seen. It was one of the many black and white things that became grey in this book. Other characters are also layered deeper in this book, for the better, which is always a plus. Upon Harry visiting Snape's past through the Pensieve (seen in Book 4), we see young Lupin, Sirius, James, and Lily, providing a better sense of cause and effect with how they all turned out to be. Still, while I can't help but dwell on the unique ending for this book, leaving Harry not exactly an all-wonderous hero, I very much enjoyed Harry's reactions to certain criticism in this book, making him seem all the more human. For the first time, he wasn't so humble with his incredible feats of the past stories, but became angry with not being fully recognized for the sheer magnitude of them. The long-awaited pushing aside of his modesty is topped off by a certain illegal organization he leads where he discusses how he managed to survive and triumph in the life-threatening events of the other books. Finally, some recognition is being demanded. The relationship between Cho and Harry in this story is odd, expressing nothing but guys' inability to understand the female mind, but you get a good idea of Harry's coming of age when by the end, he thinks of Cho as something of the past, after everything he's been through. So, despite my mixed feelings in this review, overall let me say this book, in my opinion, was enjoyable to read. It wasn't exactly 870 pages of eye-gluing suspense, but with any hope it will be at least a good seguay into the next book, whenever that may come out. But when you think about it, while the other books had the sorcerer's stone, 16-yr-old Voldemort, betrayal/dementors/timetravelling, and the return of voldemort, respectively, the climatic element of this story is much less, um, significant. It pertains to the relationship between Harry and Voldemort and many of us may have guessed it anyway, leaving us simlpy with the thought that someone (I won't say who) needlessly dies, little is accomplished, and it's basically Harry and Dumbledore's fault. I should also note that while all the other books had at least one 'section' of the plot that caused my heart to race with suspension, just wanting to know the event would turn out, and caused me to pause to really take in the outcome before continuing to read, there was no point like that in this one. So, on a final note, JK Rowling still has not lost her touch, and while the death sequence of the story somewhat confused me, she still has a wonderful knack for creative writing expressed just as well in this book as the others. Though I don't think this book was the best yet, it's still, haha, one of the best books I've ever read, and if you plan on reading the sixth book, well as you may guess this is filled with answers and questions that no doubt will play a larger role as the Harry Potter series wraps up in the final two books over the coming years.",FALSE,2003,1470

I had originally thought of it as more of a ""filler"" book to get us through another year at hogwarts before starting the REAL battle with Voldemort in years 6 and 7.What I've come to realize about this book is that it's all about character development and ""stage"" development which weren't exactly filler.  Rowling accomplished two things that needed to happen:  she added depth to Harry's character by showing that all his intuitions aren't always correct, and his gung-ho charge-in mentality can be destructive and deadly.  He has become a fallible character, albeit wiser and more of an adult.Rowling also showed us the society outside of Hogwarts that Harry would eventually have to deal with.  A petty, gossipy place that is quite similar to the Muggles world.  He fights not only voldemort and his death eaters, but he also fights personal character battles.  Harry's feelings were always elated when going back to hogwarts in each book.  however...Rowling has made it so that harry realizes that his struggles will be the same in either world.

"3998",3,731195,FALSE,"I was a little disappointed in this book. Not that it was horrible or anything, but it was nowhere near as good as The Goblet of Fire. (minor spoilers below...)Good stuff: This is the most heavily character-based book of the series so far. It's not just the big 3 (Harry, Ron, Hermione) who get face-time - the other kids, teachers, the members of the Order and even the Dursleys all get flushed out, generally to good effect. The new villainess of the piece is well and truly contemptible - I was happy to see her suffer defeats. The overall ambiance of fear and paranoia was well done and appropriate, given what happened in book 4. Rowling's easy-going writing is still quite readable, and several scenes (notably teen Snape meeting teen James Potter) were powerful and sometimes chilling.Bad Stuff: Two main things cut down my enjoyment of the book. For starters, in such a huge tome, surprisingly little happens. There's no central element driving the plot (ala the trwizard tournament, finding what's petrifying people etc) and the storyline, such as it is, leaves the book little different at the end than the start. Think about it: in the first 4 books (especially #4) when the plot comes together at the end, you can go back and see all the clues and foreshadowing that were leading up to it, where all the red herrings led into minor elements of their own, all good. Nothing like that happens here. At all. The ""big secret"" that is revealed at the end is woefully underwhelming. Plus, stuff that should have gotten a bit more page time is glossed over quickly. In the denouement, one event fans have been waiting/hoping for happens, with barely any mention.The second problem is Harry himself. Throughout the book he's angry, verbally abusive, sullen... not very likable. Yes, I know, he's becoming a teen and is definitely under stress and has reason to be in a bad mood given all that's happened/happening.... except that his mood never changes. Other characters step up for Harry with friendship and loyalty, in a big way, but this seems to bounce off him like water off a duck. And at the story's end, he's pretty much in the same state, no growth or evolution of his character occurs.Here's hoping Rowling gets a little more back in the groove in book 6.",FALSE,2003,1474
"4000",4,731922,FALSE,"First I must say that I am only reading the Harry Potter series to see what all the fuss is about. I am not a fan or anything like that, so I guess I can say my opinion is unbiased. This book was the best one so far. It seemed much more interesting and there was more going on than in the first two books. The characters are finally starting to become interesting. However, I find it very annoying that Rowling uses the same basic plot over and over in her books. To anyone who is paying attention, it is plain that this is the same book as the other two, just written with a different problem and characters. It is enjoyable, if not great. The writing is just not as wonderful as everyone seems to think. Anyway, I do have one thing to say in defense of Harry Potter. IT IS NOT DEMONIC WORSHIP OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU CHRISTIANS THINK IT IS. I am not a Christian, I will say that quite openly. I don't know what all the fuss is about with the Christians. I know many fundamental Christians and they all LOVE Lord of the Rings. I do not get the difference. They are both fantasy about trying to defeat evil. Is it because Tolkien was Christian? I don't know, maybe Rowling is Christian too. I just want to say that this book will not poison your children's minds. If you don't want your children to read this book, it means you aren't secure enough in your faith to face anyone who disagrees. It's as simple as that.

Come on! I don't know many teenagers who were or are as angry as Harry! The stuff at the end of the book describing Harry being moody was more an accurate reflection on teenagers than the angry Harry of the long introduction! So, be warned, Harry is tiresomely angry for the first 200 odd pages...But after that, the book really picks up! Some of the new characters in this book are sensational - and the new Defence of the Dark arts teacher - she's special!

Umbridge alone adds a marvelous new layer to this book!Plot twists abound, classes, fantastic battles are described vividly by Rowling to replay in full technicolour in your mind. In fact, one of the most disconcerting things about reading this book is I hadn't seen any of the films before reading the other books and kept catching myself thinking as I read this book, ""that will be interesting to see translated onto the big screen"" because the most beautiful thing about this book is Rowling wrote it for the READER and their imagination, not the big screen!

""Too much Harry Potter (too long and disjointed)."" Both are right. Neither distracts from a 5-star review.This is thematically and emotionally the most complex of the books to date. So what if it reads like the middle of a longer work-that's exactly what it is. It answers a few puzzles (why aren't Harry's parents also hanging around with Nearly Headless Nick and the other ghosts?), raises new puzzles, visits old friends (and enemies), and introduces new ones. Rowling has the courage to let her character go through a difficult period as a surly teenager and takes the opportunity to drive home a message on the importance (and difficulty) of controlling one's temper. If her core audience gets the message, why complain that the learning process makes Harry a bit less enjoyable company than he's been before? This is a book whose author hasn't forgotten what it feels like to be a teenager.There are a few quibbles. The first 200 pages are slow. The action doesn't really get going until we get back to Hogwarts and meet the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. There's a subplot regarding Hagrid that comprises two chapters and has only the most indirect bearing on anything else (although I suspect that Rowling is likely to return to it in book 6 or 7).

There's a subplot involving time travel--which really does screw up the whole series, if you think about it...why doesn't Harry just go back in time in every book and fix problems at his own leisure, with no rush at all?  There's also the introduction of ""dementors,"" evil prison guard wraiths that are perfect metaphors for depression: creatures that break your will by sucking all the joy out life.  They may be J.K. Rowling's way of subtly introducing a fairly adult them into a kids series.The main problem with this book is that, aside from introducing prominent new characters, it does nothing to move the whole story of the series forward.  Even the guy who adapted into a movie has said as much.  Nothing in this book has to do directly with the series's main story, the battle between the evil Lord Voldemort and the gifted Harry Potter.  It's kind of just another episode in the story, and doesn't add significantly to the overall saga.  ...Though, that's not to say you wouldn't be totally lost reading Book Four if you didn't read this one.

This time Harry's summer of boredom and solitude at the Dursley's is cut short when he is suddenly attacked. Harry is whisked away to his Uncle Sirus' house where a group has gathered to combat the ever-growing power of Voldemort. Harry returns to school under clouds of suspicion about his role in last year's tragic events and his assertions that Voldemort has returned. The Ministry of Magic, and Hogwarts, is deeply divided on whether or not Voldemort is back and a new teacher arrives to make Harry's life difficult. Through the course of the school year Harry must deal with the usual trials of Malfoy, studying and trying to woo Cho Chang while also coping with Voldemort returning and people not believing him.Rowling has not lost any of the charm or action that made the first four Potter books international best-sellers. The plot is crisp and the action never seems to stop. As usually there is a good twist at the end of the book that will leave people guessing. All of your favorite characters are back, Ron, Hermoine, Dumbledore, etc. At various times in this book I found myself laughing out loud as everyone at the school tried to deal with the teacher sent by the Ministry of Magic to keep an eye on Hogwarts. The stunts pulled by the Weasley twins make it worth it to read this book. Harry also has a chance to further explore his feelings for Cho Chang and it made for a more personal story-line. I keep waiting for Ron and Hermoine to get together - maybe I am reading too much into but I have a feeling they will eventually.This book is darker then it predecessors. Although some people would consider this a criticism, it does make sense as Voldemort has returned. Think of this book as some what like ""The Empire Strikes Back,""  for the time being the dark side is winning. What kind of bad guys would we have if they didn't make things a little difficult for our heroes. Harry is definitely in his teenage years in this book - he spends considerable time whining and complaining about no one believing or trusting him. Sometimes this does make for some ponderous reading, but I think it is an accurate portrait of a teenager. Looking back now I don't think I even talked to anyone the whole time I was 15. Teenagers are moody and Harry is a teenager.I think this book is a great edition to this magnificent series. Every series has a middle section where it seems the bad guys are going to win and nothing is going right - that is where Harry Potter is now. I'm sure the next few books will pick up the pace again.

Harry once again begins at the place he most dreads, his Aunt and Uncle Dursley's house.  Harry desperately wishes to be with his friends, but knows that he may have to wait until he gets back to school.  After getting another letter from the Ministry of Magic, however, Harry finally gets to reunite with Hermione and Ron.  He founds out, however, things there aren't as great as he thought that they would be.  The trip back to Hogwarts was what Harry thought would set him straight.  There, however, he also finds out that life isn't easy.  Some things that he has to deal with are:  preparing for the dreaded Ordinary Wizarding Level exams (O.W.L.S.), dreams about walking down a deep, dark hallway, changes in the defending champion Gryffindor Quidditch team, a nasty new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and the fact that the man closest to him, Albus Dumbledore, will not speak to him.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a book that you will not be able to put down without a struggle.  Although it is the longest book of the series, I also think it is the best.  The 870 pages feel like nothing with the non-stop action, dazzling magic, and new found relationships.

I think Goblet of Fire is the best in the series, so naturally it would be pretty difficult for Phoenix to live up to that standard.  In Goblet, it feels like Rowling had a fantastic ending in mind, and that drove the writing of the story.  In Phoenix, it seems like the story is key and the ending was simply tacked on to round it out and provide some concluding information.  The major theme seemed to be the Ministry's takeover of Hogwarts.  I found that entire thread to be thoroughly engrossing.  Harry's dreams, however, took on sub-plot status, and then rose to the top for the final conflict.  I didn't mind the length of the book, but it did seem to drag in a couple of places.  The gang spent too much time at Grimmauld Place.  I could have also done without Hagrid's giant story.  My biggest problem with the book was Dumbledore's secrecy.  Good stories have real roadblocks to keep the hero from achieving his/her goal.  In Phoenix, the cause for most of the confusion was that Dumbledore was reluctant to share certain information with Harry.  He explains his behavior in a most unconvincing way in the final pages.  The secrecy was necessary for the story to take the course that it did, but it lacked good motivation and left me feeling let down.  It reminded me of the natural disaster movie template where the world could be easily saved if not for an arrogant bureaucrat who refuses to listen to the young upstart with all the answers.  It is contrived conflict that is hardly believable.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the Harry Potter series.  And, perhaps my expectations have risen too high.

When I finished the book, I just sat back and contemplated what's to come, filled with sorrow for Harry and the wizarding world.That said, I was delighted to read the book, and to see how J.K. Rowling has continued to flesh out the wizarding world.  I really enjoyed the book, even if the pacing was sometimes uneven.  This really is a good continuation from Book 4, although you will be similarly agonized at the end and the prospect of waiting again for Book 6.  Harry is growing up, and his character is really showing that nicely.  We learn less about the development of the other child characters (Ron and Hermione seem to swimming in the same lazy circles), but the adult characters and the social order of the wizarding world are much more nuanced.  This book suffers from middle chapter syndrome -- but it is still really worthwhile.",FALSE,2003,1468
"4026",5,731187,FALSE,"I think I am probably correct in assuming, that all those people who became fans of J.K. Rowling and her one-of-a-kind Children's series while reading her other four books, have probably already read and possibly re-read the newest installment in the Harry Potter adventures, `Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix'.So, instead of wasting anyone's time by writing my review like I think that anyone who fell in love with Harry five years ago needs convincing, I'll write this for all of you who haven't yet fallen under Harry's spell.So, who knows when it was that you first heard of the Harry Potter books, and who cares? Its not as if its something you're interested in. Not so my Harry-oblivious friend, because once upon a time I was very similar to yourself.Let me tell you a story. Three years ago, I was thirteen, in eighth grade, in love with all five members of `Nsync and convinced I wanted nothing to do with Harry Potter. To me, The Harry Potter books were stupid, children's fantasy novels that could never hold the attention of the future Mrs. Justin Timberlake. I was not ""into"" reading at all, let alone a book about something that did not involve shallow American teenyboppers, and besides my ten-year-old sister read Harry Potter... ""ew!""But the fact remained school was an ever-present part of my life, and each quarter I was forced against my will to read a book of my choice and take a computerized test on it, so in the second quarter (mainly because my family owned it) I chose `Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'. Much to my disgust, I loved it.So now lets talk about you. For the past months, you've been rolling your eyes at all the little nine-year-olds with ""count down to HP5"" calendars in their bedrooms, laughing callously at the cardboard cutouts of an animated Harry in every bookstore window, and nursing your contempt for all those above the age of twelve who think the books are worth the time of day...or maybe you haven't, maybe you just don't care, but still don't you think it was a better story when you were?In my opinion, `Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix' is just as good a book as its four predecessors. Rowling has successfully transformed her main character from a curious little boy to a heroic adolescent. The plot thickens and while the fifth book is noticeably darker, I have yet to meet someone who was bothered by this.With her newest publication, Rowling has sealed the deal on establishing Harry as good literature rather than mind-cluttering entertainment. The Harry Potter books will most likely go down in history, just like their title character in the stories themselves.So why wouldn't you read Harry Potter? In thirty years do you want to be that person who says: ""Yes, I was around when Harry Potter was first published, but I didn't read it."" Or when you're playing 2045's edition of Trivial Pursuit, do you want to be the player who has to say: ""Uh..."" when the question is: ""What is the name of Harry Potter's best friend?"" (It's Ron, by the way). No, of course you don't. So do yourself a favor and buy all five Harry Potter books immediately. I promise you'll like them.",FALSE,2003,1466

Again wicked forces want to destroy Harry and his friends, and again it is up to them to stop the destruction.  The new creatures, courses, and characters fit in well with the world that J. K.  Rowling has created, and you and/or your child will grow to love or despise  each and every one of them. It retained the magic, mischief, and  intelligence of its predecessors, but had a more mature tone. The villains  and evil creatures had a much darker presence than those of past books, and  the meddlesome Muggles (non-magic populus) even more odious.In a sense  the writing has grown just as Harry has in the past three years.  Some of  the themes are a lot less whimsical: death, revenge, and powerlessness.  The plot, too, is more mature.  Concepts like time travel paradoxes could  be over some heads, and the plot lines were rather involved, compared to  the first two books.  Know the child you are giving this to.  Perhaps the  young reader has grown at the same rate.I could imagine being a ten year  old and fantasizing about all of the wonderful things I could do if I had  one fourth of Harry's powers.  I could also imagine identifying with many  of the struggles of Harry and his friends- bullies, adults who don't  understand you, overextending yourself, and trying to fill the shoes of  older siblings.As an adult who grew up on the innocence of the Oz  series (L.Frank Baum, Ruth P. Thompson), I was reminded of the enjoyment I  felt reading about such fanciful adventures. I think I would have enjoyed  the Potter series when I had graduated from the Oz books.

"4028",3,731218,FALSE,"After gaining my interest with the first four Harry Potter books, author Rowling managed to use up all of my good will in a single reading of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"".  Harry has grown into a whiny teenaged punk with attitude and an opinion on everything.  Some have suggested this makes Harry believable, as this is how real teenagers act.  To them I say: if I wanted to be exposed to real teenagers, I wouldn't be reading fantasy, would I?For a book coming in at well over the 500-page mark, HPOP actually has very little to say.  Fortunately, however, it says it repeatedly, so those of you who missed on the first go will be bonked on the head until comprehension sets in. The actions of the book's principle players are inexplicably out of character and convoluted, which allows the book to ramble on, creating false tension.  If anyone spoke his mind and cleared the air, the book would be a one hundred-page pamphlet.This is not to say that parts of the book are not enjoyable.  Many have pointed out the darker tone to this book, which makes it more entertaining to me.  Rowling has also retained the signature humor.  But I'd be happier if she learned to tell her tale, drop the adjectives and remember which characters are which, so they don't get confused about whether they are supposed to be helping Harry or hindering him, concealing the truth or exposing it.  And if Harry himself could just bring himself to say, ""I'm sorry,"" he might have a powerful friend for life.",FALSE,2003,1497
"4029",5,730422,FALSE,"JK Rowling and her magical creation, Harry Potter, just keep getting better.  The first was great, the second was greater, but there was no chance that Harry Potter 3 could compete with them.  In fact, it surpassed the first two.Harry Potter is growing along with its reader.  Now 13, he's in his third year at Hogwarths.  There is a chance that the book could settle down and become routine.  But it doesn't.  The Prisoner of Azkaban is a much darker novel than its predecessors.  This book is menacing, terrifying.  Kids of all ages will adore it.The plot concerns an escaped prisoner.  A former ally of Harry's father, the prisoner betrayed James Potter and sided with You-know-who.  Free from his awful imprisonment, the prisoner vows revenge on Harry Potter.To be fair, the book has weaknesses.  It drags for a moment in the middle.  It seems that Rowling is stalling before she delivers the requisite twist.  And the time travel device secretly used by Hermione throughout was too predictable.  Who didn't see it coming?  Well, Harry and Ron didn't, but they were the only two, I presume.However, the book overcomes these weaknesses with its triumphant last act.  It doesn't end with much of a battle like the previous two, instead the fight is very much a verbal one.  Hopefully this trend will continue in the later books as it is a far more suspenseful device than a run-of-the-mill shootout.  A lengthy conversation between the three kids and three adults (I won't tell you who!) irons out all the questions that the reader had.  It also manages to inform Harry of some of his past.A major secret that explains plenty of James Potter's history is revealed near the conclusion.

No news of Ron or Hermione, or even his godfather, Sirius Black. But after two Dementors were sent to attack Harry in Little Whinging, Harry starts to wonder what this is all about.What I found was a bit of a drawback was that the story took an extremely long time in developping and it was only during the 150 page or so that the book really started to get interesting.J.K. Rowling creates more depth into the Harry Potter character. As he grows older, readers come to realize that Harry is no longer the self-controlled and happy boy he used to be. In fact, it seems that all of his anger is bubbling up inside of him, and he has to get it out somehow. Harry seems more and more realistic, and teenagers will often be able to relate to his realistic side. In fact, his personality is becoming more and more like one of an adolescent: Harry no longer cares if he gets into detention, all he wants to do is scream at Professor Umbridge, the new Defence Aginst the Dark Arts teacher, who does not believe that Lord Voldmort has returned. Even though this was an interesting aspect of Harry's, at times I found that it was a bit annoying and I really felt like shaking Harry and screaming at him myself because he was just wallowing in self-pity.A new relationship is also starting to develop between Harry and Cho Chang, and this creates an even more realistic Potter; in fact, I was able to penetrate inside his skin more than ever with his new rebellious attitude.This book is full of new discoveries for Harry about love, death and a shocking discovery about his father. Harry soon comes to realize that people aren't always what they seem to be, and as the readers' plunge deeper into the wizard world, Harry becomes more acquainted with his true feelings and his connection with He Who Must Not Be Named.J.K. Rowling portrayed Umbridge beautifully and I think that she perfectly transmitted all of the hate Harry felt towards her to the readers'. She was a most despicable character and I think that is what made the story much more interesting.However, as a new villain enters the story, another enemy of Harry changes roles. My favourite chapter was when Harry got to see Snape's worst memory. Rowling makes the readers' have more pity upon Snape and, by doing so, makes us learn the truth about James Potter and Severus Snapes' relationship and why Snape hated Harry so.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has been highly anticipated, and it definitely does not let the fans down even though it is not as suspenseful and intriguing as the previous books. I was also a bit disappointed by the ending. The ""big revelation"" that Dumbeldore was going to tell Harry wasn't as big as I thought it was, though it certainly was one more clearing in all of this mystery.

"4031",5,731196,FALSE,"Holding in my hands the fifth Harry Potter novel - a towering, monolithic adventure spanning 870 pages - I have to wonder how different The Order of the Phoenix might have been had Potter-mania not caught on the way it did. When Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone hit shelves back in 1998, it was a modest and taut 309-page read. (Well, OK, it still is. As far as I know, the book hasn't morphed into Sammy Davis Jr.'s Yes I Can since last I checked.) Over the years, the books have grown and grown, which is fine, except the stories haven't always been able to keep pace.Such is the case with Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix, a darkly exciting novel that builds from an intriguing opening to a mundane middle, and finishes with a suspenseful, spectacular climax. Spreading the plot anemically like this allows readers to spend a great deal of time just living in Harry's world, where we watch events from his perspective unfold in almost real-time. This does much to endear the reader to the characters - you genuinely feel like you're in this together as you read - but it's not for the impatient.If you're new to Harry Potter, this is not the place to start. Things pick up with almost no back-tracking as we find ourselves now five years into the events of an increasingly complex arc.

I thought the 5th installment was a worthy entry into the Harry Potter series. Though it wasn't as fast paced or as adventurous as her earlier works. The Order of the Phoenix and its mammoth 870 pages did have a seriousness that made it a worthwhile read over all.Harry is now 16 yrs old, puberty is taking its toll and Harry is no longer the kid we remember him as. J.K. Rawlings is now taking her characters to new levels of maturity; Harry now faces new adventures in his life, which can't be solved with a wand. We are shown many life lessons and I will admit that I loved that aspect of the book a lot.As we read along we are seeing Harry Mature and realize that even wizards don't have it easy and that life is not a picnic, as we would like it to be. Hence, Rawlings sheds a wave of reality to her younger readers as well as older ones. I believe she is showing us, that once the bookends we shouldn't think wizards (or ourselves for that matter) don't have it any easier, but we will get what we desire through hard work and trial and error.But finally the last 100 pages of this book flew by and had me glued for 2 solid hours till it ended, but I think this is a bit large for a children's book but it did flow well and I can't complain.

The characters we've come to know and love are presented here at their most vulnerable state, making them all the more real.  Thus, this book is full of emotion and tension.  Harry, 15 now, has all the characteristics of a full-blown, angst-ridden teenager.  No longer the sweet innocent boy we were introduced to in Sorcerer's Stone, Harry is the angriest I've ever seen him.  Of course, taking into account what he goes through this time around, it is no wonder he feels this way.  A truly despicable character is introduced here...the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge.  This is by far the most evil character in the series.  I daresay she's worse than Voldemort!  Halfway through the book I found myself thinking up several horrific ends for her.  Along the way, several important revelations are made about almost all the characters...including Harry's Aunt Petunia!

Perhaps not as big a jump as the difference between ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire,"" ""Order of the Phoenix"" definitely kicks it up a notch from its immediate predecessor.  No spoilers here, but be prepared for many more ""mature"" themes and intense scenes as Harry matures himself intellectually, emotionally, and, of course, magically.

It was well-worth the wait, no matter how painful that wait was.  To prepare yourself, you should review ""Goblet of Fire"" so you know where things left off a couple years ago.

Book 5 will make much more sense that way, due to the fact that OoTP takes dynamite to the patterns of books 1-4 and blows it sky high!  Everything you've assumed about the Wizarding world, and Harry Potter (his history, his personality, his future) has been thoroughly ""disillusioned""!2.  For the parent whose child has enjoyed the books thus far, and the child may be under 13 (perhaps even under 10): if you are screening your child's reading material, there are some themes in this book -- namely somewhat graphic scenes of death, adolescent ""stuff"" (nothing too heavy--first crush, first kiss sorts of things) and intense emotional reactions (including a briefly voiced death wish) -- that you may want to pre-empt before letting your child read this book.  This installment of Harry Potter is more for teenagers 12+ (maybe 13+) than for the younger set who may be still expecting magic spells, exciting adventures, mysteries to solve, and Dumbledore making things all right in the end.  (Of course, adults are free to read at will!).3.  For the person who's sill new to the Harry Potter saga and wants to ""just"" read Book 5--it's your choice, but you'll be hopelessly lost if you ""just"" read Book 5.  Significant saga plot points are revealed here that tie in to Books 1-4, and significant character development occurs throughout the book that set up the reader for future Books 6 and 7.With that said, my review of Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix is--OoTP is a triumph!  Ms. Rowling continues to amaze me with how the whole saga has unfolded up to now.  The emotional tone of the book is somber, dark (for real!), unrelenting, and not comforting in the least.

I finally finished this very long drawn out book. In my opinion, the book was another good Potter installment. But it was way too long. There was so much in this that just could have been left out. Also, there were some things that I found to be pretty unbelievable... first off, Harry's relationship (or lack thereof) with Cho. I find it hard to believe that a 15 year old boy (especially in our times) would not even want to hold a girls hand let alone kiss her. Also, I understand that Harry needs to be ""angry"" in this novel, but when that is all he is, it gets a little dull. I am not saying that I did not enjoy this book, I actually enjoyed it very much. There were just some things that could of made it much better. Also one hope for the 6th Harry Potter... I hope that they finally get a good Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher.

Some people don't like the fact that James wasn't always an angel.  He grew out of it, people.

Especially if Snape kept up his end and fought back?And the darkness...  Well, I didn't think this book was all that much darker than the fourth.  The introduction of the Death Eaters, the murder of that muggle in the beginning, the revelations of the murders of Crouch Sr. and Riddle Sr., the re-union in the cemetery at the end,  and Cedric's death all join together to make the fourth book pretty dark as well.

Other reviewers have critisized her portrayal of Harry as an angry, self-conscious teenager. However, I think this was a wise choice. Other reviewers have complained that Rowling took away their hero. On the contrary, I think that Rowling made Harry more real and thus more admirable and easy to identify with. I felt that his feelings, although sometimes irrational, were understandable.I also want to commend Rowling on her introduction of possibly the most detestable character ever written: Dolores Umbridge. I picture this woman as the monotone Jabba the Hut-looking monster in Monsters, Inc. She is truly horrible, and it reflects well on Rowling that readers feel strong emotions when reading her book. Umbridge isn't even a character you love to hate, like Snape, you just HATE her.I won't give anything away, but my one disappointment was that certain characters did not get their come-uppance or did not get enough of one.

"4050",5,731527,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, by J.K. Rowling is the third novel in her entertaining fantasy series about Harry Potter, a teenage wizard and his encounters with the evil LordVoldemort.  Being a new reader to the fantasy world, I was delightfully surprised.  The vivid descriptions and enticingly fun characters make this novel and its series a must read for all young and old who enjoy the possibilities and illusions of magic.  Harry Potter is not an intellectual book by any means, but it has a certain allure all its own.  To be able to slip away and to envision a magical place like Hogwarts Castle with Harry, Ron, and Hermione is an experience.  It's almost as if the story comes to life in your mind's eye and the magnitude of the experience is unforgettable. I enjoyed this book so much after the first time I read it, that I reread it eight times in succession.  The character flaws of Harry are endearing and create a sense of friendship between the reader and him.  With both petty and insignificant conflict as well as tear-jerking and serious uproars, the novel keeps readers on their toes.  After every time I read this particular book I tended to learn more and make my own impressions about what exactly this book mean andrepresents.  I think this book is very well written, and even though it is a fantasy book, J.K. Rowling throws real life in the mix of this novel to make it more real and therefore better.",FALSE,2004,1806
"4051",5,731189,FALSE,"The sun was beginning to rise as I put down HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX at quarter-past five this morning.  I had made it through 870 pages and was left with the heavy, almost drunken feeling that comes only from reading a truly excellent book.  I absolutely hate spoilers, whether they're given to me or given by me, so I'm not going to write much about the plot, but, rest assured, it's excellent and doesn't slow until the end of the book, when the pace drops abruptly and becomes almost boring for a Harry Potter book.  But there's a reason for this, and anyone who has ever felt an emotion will not be bored.The story is far better as well as more realistic than previous books.  When compared to HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCEROR (PHILOSOPHER)'S STONE, it's almost unbelievable how much the story has matured.  While the movies and toys may market these stories to younger children, PLEASE think twice before letting a child under the age of ten read this book.  Part of what makes it so good is that, like in Robert Cormier's THE CHOCOLATE WAR, the good guys do not always win, the bad guys are not always punished, and people who are lying are often believed because people simply do not want to believe the truth.  While this is a very true-to-life course of action for Rowling to take, it is too mature for young children and quite a few older ones too.  Heck, it might even be too mature (or close-to-home) for some adults.  It is NOT a fairy tale.I almost gave this book a 4-star rating for the simple fact that the book is too long, and parts could and should be cut out, but Rowling has demonstrated in her writings that even the most irrelevent details may quickly become of importance later in the series.  Example, a reference to Sirius Black was made in the first book, but this character was not explored until the third.What's spectacular about this book is its ability to show that good people do not always do the right thing.  Harry, his friends, their families, his godfather, even Dumbledore, and even more shockingly his own father, are shown making mistakes, like real people do.  Even his aunt and uncle, typically used by the series as a joke of intolerant and stupid people, are shown, in parts, to be good people at heart.  In many stories, the good guys never make mistakes, and that's what shows how very true-to-life the Potter books are becoming.",FALSE,2003,1468

Having received my copy I began reading it right away and was instantly transported back to the magical world of Harry and his friends.The first half of the book was brilliant and lived up to the standard of the previous books--indeed surpassed it at times! When Harry finally gets to Hogwarts again the standard is maintained and the book thrills, building up the tension and excitement but unfortunately the final third of the book at times drags and does not live up to the excitement developed earlier; indeed, the denouement--after all the brilliant build-up--is a bit of a let down and that is the biggest downfall of this fifth book. After the great hype surrounding the identity of the person who we knew beforehand was to be killed, the actual character who dies is not that major and this too was disappointing (although a relief too!) And the 'great' revelation which Prof. Dumbledore makes to Harry is not very groundbreaking either! Harry also is not as likable in this installment being all moody and stroppy for large tracts of the book( intentionally but still)! There are of course many new characters and the most horrid Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher yet! She is absolutely horrid!

In other words: prepare your young wizard or witch accordingly: This book may be too intense for very young readers. Also, Harry suffers a great, personal loss as someone very dear ""shuffles off this mortal coil"" (i.e.: dies). As Ms Rowling transforms from very good to great writer, she finds she can't resist satirising several institutions of British life, notably tabloid newspapers. Her sharp barbs also stick in the craw of the British education establishment, most notably in the toadlike personage of Ms. Dolores Umbridge, as pedantic a teacher as ever graced fiction. The reader will quickly finish all 870 pages and beg for more, especially to answer such questions as: Who will die? Will Ron and Hermoine ever get together?, and will Harry finally get to kick the Dursleys in the quaffle??? (Sorry, couldn't resist a little Quidditch joke.) Finally, it doesn't matter if you are fifteen years old or 50, and have ten kids or none: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (yes, the book explains what the Order of the Phoenix is) is pure, unadulterated fun, and you should get a copy right away!!!",FALSE,2003,1478

The book starts off like the beginning of an action/suspense movie, and doesn't let go of you until the very, very end.  Be warned: if you're expecting the same formula, same world, same ""innocent"" tone as the first four books, you'll be sorely disappointed.  Ms. Rowling took Dynamite to the foundations of all our assumptions about Harry Potter, the Dursleys, the Ministry of Magic, and the entire Wizarding World and blew them SKY HIGH!!You'll meet several new characters, find out LOTS more about other characters (including some disturbing news about the relationship between Professor Snape and James Potter), and see the development of other main characters.  Ginny is featured more, and Neville especially has grown up a lot.Harry comes of age (emotionally, if not chronologically) in this book, and he is, at long last, justifiably angry at the entire situation he's been born into--and is not afraid to express that anger at everybody.  Most of his battles in this book come from within his own conflicted heart as he struggles to relate with his closest friends and deal with his own inner demons.  He experiences disillusionment about the behavior of certain adult figures in his life, grapples with the darkness of his connection with Voldermort, and will discover the horrible truth (finally) about his ultimate destiny.Not that the entire book is unrelentingly dark.  There are humorous moments, glorious escapes, tender parts to help sweeten the bitter tone of the story.  Especially watch the wonderful antics of Fred & George doing battle against the ""establishment""!This installment of the Harry Potter saga is the most action/suspense packed, information-stuffed, emotion-filled story of the series yet published.  This book also, I hope, finally puts to rest the idea that this is merely a ""children's"" book series.

This book is better than the second Harry Potter book and almost as good as the first.  Definetely a fun read. There are two points that I feel need mentioned.The first is not a complaint, just a little heads up for parents who may want to know.  This book is for a somewhat older child than the first two.  There is a small bit of ""language"" (very tiny amount, but parents who may be offended should be aware).The second point is a bit of a complaint.  As with the second book, the author again spent quite a bit of time going over information from the first book (in order to make this book stand-alone for the reader who did not read the previous books).  I find this to be annoying in a serial book.  Readers who do not take the time to read the first books should not be catered to in the latter books of any series.  Furthermore, for the reader who has read the first books, the rehashing of old material gives the story a feeling of marking time.  The reader is no longer in the story, rather is just waiting for the author to finish catching up those who are behind and get on with the story. For this reason, I have taken away one star.",FALSE,2002,1035
"4064",5,731559,FALSE,"The fifth installment of the Harry Potter series shows a darker side to Harry's attitude. Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are Harry's best friends and are in the book most of the time. Other main characters are the new defence against the dark arts teacher, high inquisitor, and worker for the ministry of magic, Professor Umbridge, who is there to spy on Hogwarts and pass on information to Cornelius Fudge, the minister of magic, who is still in denial of Voldemort coming back. Voldemort is a dark wizard who murdered Harry's parents, but could not manage to kill him.Harry's fifth year of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is absolute misery. A sudden disapearance of Rubeus Hagrid - a half-giant who is Harry, Ron, and Hermione's friend and teaches Care Of Magical Creatures -, the overruling power of Professor Umbridge, who makes up many crude rules to fit her liking, a dream that actually is happening miles away in which he is a snake and tries to kill Arthur Weasley, Dumbledores ignorance of Harry, his ban from Quidditch, whilst the new keeper who turns out to be Ron plays rubbishly in his matches, mysterious never-ending corridors, and a pressurising amount of homework leading up to their life-changing tests, OWLs, add up to a bad year. The only thing keeping him going is the ""club"" he co-founded with Hermione so that pupils can learn defensive magic, as Umbridge disallows any kind of magic in her classes, in fear that they will try to make an army against the ministry of magic. The ""club"" is called Dumbledore's Army (DA for short).I thought that the death of a main character could have been done much better, though. My favourite chapter is Chapter 28 ""Snape's Worst Memory"" where Harry finds out about Snape's past when he was in Hogwarts along with Harry's late parents Lily & James. Chapter 20 ""Hagrid's Tale"" did not need to be in there, as it made no difference to the plot. In all, Hagrid's disappearance was unnecessary, as I thought he may have been guarding the mysterious weapon or something that the Order Of The Phoenix are using to defend themselves against Voldemort. It was a dissapointing outcome. Other great chapters include Chapter Five (The Order Of The Phoenix), Chapter 8 (The Hearing), Chapter 18 (Dumbledore's Army), Chapter 21 (The Eye Of The Snake) and chapter 32 (Out Of The Fire). Other bad chapters are Chapter 30 (Grawp) and the 1st part of Chapter 27 (The Centaur And The Sneak). Read this book if you have not yet & ignore the bad reviwers - they didn't read it carefully enough and don't realise the stress of being a teenager.

"4067",5,731190,FALSE,"I won't give anything away in this review, but ""Order of the Phoenix"" is excellent.  It's easily the darkest novel yet, and Harry has become more human as he hits adolescence full-on, which makes him more endearing.  He's a moody and sometimes frustrating character.  He is also asked to handle more than he's ever had to before, and this novel becomes a big rite of passage for him.  The plot is pretty involved and the atmosphere is more edgy, but there are still wonderful moments of humor, magic and triumph.  Be ready for an intense climax that is extremely suspenseful; everybody is fair game and one of them - though I'm still in mourning and denial about this myself - falls in battle.  The vile Umbridge character is one of Rowling's most vivid antagonists for Harry, and Ron and Hermione feature largely.  Hagrid, Dumbledore and McGonagall seem to get a little less face time this round, while non-teachers Lupin, Sirius and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley get a little more, though all seven have immensely integral parts to play.  If the final pages of the book are bittersweet, it is not only because the plot has taken us there; I didn't want the story to end, and must now go back and start reading the books all over again.  It is now nostalgiac for us (and Harry) to recall that magical first year of discovery, as in this novel he grows amidst support and adversity, happiness and loss, and comes to terms with news that means Books 6 and 7 are going to be just as exciting, heartbreaking and rewarding as this one.

Rowling warned us in interviews that this Harry Potter book would be darker than the rest, and she wasn't kidding. Still, the storytelling grabs you from the first page and keeps you spellbound (pun intended) until the very end of the book.There is a definite sense that the characters, wizard and Muggle alike, are maturing into adults. There's a lot more angst this time around, not only about Voldemort and what he might be up to, but also things that ordinary teenagers worry about. I think it really gives a new depth to characters that readers may have thought they already knew so well.Rowling also mentioned in interviews that one of main characters would be killed off, and while I didn't want to know ahead of time who it was (so I'm not going to tell you here), just knowing that someone would die gave an extra edge to the story. There are a few ""teaser"" incidents in the book that make you gasp, ""Oh, no, don't kill [fill in the blank]!"" which added even more to the suspense.We also get more of the back story involving Harry's parents, and his connection to Voldemort, which takes a surprising turn and makes the plot much more dark and complicated.

I was very pleasantly surprised to see how often it refers to previous books, especially The Prisoner of Azkaban. It was like seeing old friends you haven't thought of for a while. That being said, if you have a young child (under 7) this book is just not for them. In addition to the death of a much-loved character, the Order of the Phoenix is far too long and draws thing out way too much to keep a young child's interest. Also, the references to previous books just confuses young kids, who have enough trouble remembering things that happened yesterday. In addition, Harry is gaining his voice in this latest installment. He's not afraid to talk back, be disrespectful or even rude, and he does not bottle up his frustration and anger and anxiety like he used to -- very healthy for preteens and teens who also need to learn not to internalize their emotions, but a bad example for young children who would mimic their hero, Harry. The level of anger and angst is also a bit much for sensitive young readers. However, for those who are old enough to handle the lengthy chapters, the references, etc., the book is very entertaining, especially the continued escapades of Fred and George Weasley.

Not soon after Harry is taken to a secure place because he-who-shall-not-be-named is on the loose and Harry's life is in peril. When Harry returns to Hogwarts to rumors it's to rumors that he is mad and unbalanced. I can't really say anymore because I don't want to give away the plot, but I will say that Harry is changing. Not only is he growing older, but unfamiliar feelings and emotions begin to bombard Harry. Our young hero has to deal with being a 15 year old famous wizard, who isn't sure about himself or where he belongs. You see a different Harry and sometimes you may not be so happy with the changes. Yet, the great things is you understand and feel for Harry. Life is moving fast in a direction he isn't sure of, and puberty is just one of his problems.

Harry is now 15 years old and has become a moody, angry teenager, very different from how he has been portrayed previously. At times it is difficult to like him and sometimes his behaviour is downright annoying. However Rowling has sympathetically portrayed the 'angst' of teenagers and the difficulties of growing up whilst still managing to weave a captivating story and maintaining the magic that is Harry Potter.Favourite characters are still around as well as some new ones including the truly horrendous new defence against the dark arts teacher, Dolores Jane Umbridge who proves not only unpopular with the pupils but also upsets the majority of the staff.Harry learns more about his past in this book and also discovers why he must spend his holidays with the Dursleys even though they obviously don't want him around.

Somehow this one just felt flat.First: Style.  I think J.K.'s writing has started picking up a little ""King"" flair (as in Stephen King)....long, arduous descriptions that seem to go on for no other reason then to pad pages (don't get me wrong--I LOVE King's novellas and short stories).  I REALLY missed her breezy, fast paced writing that was the trademark of the first four books.Second: Angst.  Yes, Harry's a teenager, but must it be dwelt on to the exclusion of the plot?  And why aren't Ron and Hermione suffering the same teenager woes?  OK--so he's had a less-than-perfect life and in our world would probably be on every designer drug on the market to make him feel better about himself, but I'm not reading Harry Potter to get a belly full of a selfish, pouty teenager...I can turn on the news for plenty of that.Third: Plot.  Unfortunately, weak.  Nothing revealed we couldn't already have guessed.  Which is what I missed the most.  All the other books managed to twist your brain around the plot in a VERY fun and almost mischievous way....this book has none of that.  Nothing unexpected and nothing new.  Even the death scene was so under-played that I had to re-read it to realized someone had actually DIED, and had not simply slipped off into another realm or something.  All of the characters we've come to love were totally downplayed and seemed to spend the majority of the book hiding out behind the scenes.  I think Dobby had a half a dozen lines, and Hagrid's dialogue wasn't much better.I tore through this book in 2 reading sessions only to feel like I had been ripped off in the end....I think it's worth a read just to appease the need for the Potter fix we've all been waiting for, but don't expect the Holy Grail of Potter-dom...in my opinion that was book number 3.....hopefully the wait for book 7 will prove more worthwhile.",FALSE,2003,1473

Asked during an interview with Amazon.com about what ingredients all the Harry Potter books need, Rowling comments, ""I never really think in terms of ingredients, but I suppose if I had to name some I'd say humor, strong characters, and a watertight plot"". In 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', she accomplishes this with high distinction. If the first two books had amused me, this was the one to make me a loyal fan. There are a few laughs, but more importantly her characters are wonderfully strong and there is much more to them than at first meets the eye (so to speak). Better still, the plot - to which even the best produced and directed movie version could never hope to do true justice - is as complex and watertight as it gets. My hat off to any kid who can grasp its fullest intricacies.Maybe the most enjoyable thing about Harry Potter (for the adults amongst us) is that he takes us back to the childhood we might have wished for. Through him and his friends, we become children once more, but this time we're special, we're brilliant, and we're crucially important to all about us. Well, at least reading Harry Potter is a lot better than having a therapist say that you should run about in nappies in order to get in touch with your inner child. Thankfully, although I will not review them, the following two books are also very special.

Ms. Rowling has, in my opinion, crafted a superbly irritating and odious antagonist in the character of Dolores Umbridge, and there is probably not a reader that won't become involved in wishing her ill and becoming indignant on behalf of our student heroes.Fred and George Weasley provided, for this reader, the most entertaining sections of the story - which needed some entertaining sections, as this book is - in some ways - even darker than Goblet of Fire. I see people mentioning actors they feel should be in the film version of Order of the Phoenix, as if it's a sure thing there WILL be a film version - but if there is, it's going to be rated R for violence. It might manage to squeak out a PG-13, but I don't think Goblet of Fire can maintain its original storyline and keep clear of an R rating.All that said, I think Harry is one of the most irritating characters in the current offering - yes, I know he is an adolescent, and I know 15 year-old boys are moody and pains in the kiester; but, so are girls, and really there is no other student at Hogwarts that approaches Harry's adolescent angst. I'm reading a fantasy story; when I want a teenager as obnoxious as they are in real life, I need look no further than the next room, LOL! I think Harry could have done less YELLING in the book, and been less of a pea-head to his friends, and the story would have been just as good. It seems he launched into a self-pitying speech/inner monologue or angry tirade every other chapter.I hope he's out of this funk by the time school rolls round again! ;-)",FALSE,2003,1472

But then because there are so many red herrings, she does take up too much time at the end of the book tying up all the loose ends.One little nit I did not like, was the author's use of some words that some parents might find objectionable.

"4083",5,731189,FALSE,"First of all, it's certainly true that this book is darker and the content less comfortable.When setting expectations, the last main action of the fourth book is much more relevant than the tone of Harry's adventures before that. At the end of the fourth book, everything is different: this book necessarily has a much different feel than the rest.In addition, some basic aspects of reality were shifted at the end of the last book; which are profound.Someone who has read nothing before can certainly start with this one. I wouldn't be surprised if there's an audience for this one that wasn't interested in the others. A person starting with this one would certainly get a lot out of the others, but this one does stand on its own.Harry himself is very very challenged throughout it. And the evil, the bad guys, are more in the forefront than the other books. It isn't as simple as the others, there are contradictions and complications that chafe the reader.In that way, this book is more true-to-life and so even more of use.Because many of us can relate a great deal to being challenged and having the bad guys being in charge. Seeing how Harry and everyone else deal with it - with discipline (sometimes not enough!), unity and inner strength - is useful in our own journeys.And lots of big questions are in play as always - what does it mean to be ""good,"" in the context of relationships and in struggle and so on. What is bad, what is permanent about people and what changes, etc..The death is a huge one, and I wish it had not happened. Since there's two more books, I can't judge the necessity of it. But the reader won't be as affected as Harry.All the characters continue to be very believable and evolving. The writing continues to be suburb - fascinating, great detail, great vocabulary, very potent. Chronologically specific aspects of life are brought into effect just perfectly. And I just love the surprising bits of very dry wit that pop up unexpectedly.  Occasionally in an earlier book I'd feel a little bit adrift, that didn't happen at all in this one.  28 Hours passed from when I got my hands on it and when I was done reading it!In conclusion, this book is the best yet, in my opinion.

"4084",5,731189,FALSE,"Let me start by saying that when I got my book on Saturday and started reading, I could not put it down until I finished ten hours later!  Wow!This book is much darker, and even Hogwarts is not the refuge for Harry that it used to be.  The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is someone that would make Snape seem like a lovable teddy bear, if that gives you an idea!  Of course, when you're in your fifth year and have your OWLs to takes as well, even Hermione can be heard to feel the strain!Dumbledore is only mostly there in the background until the latter part of the book.  When you find out why, it makes sense, but in the mean time you're just as confused as Harry.Harry is 15, with all the troubles that come with that age.  He is angry, very angry, though understandably so.  The anger he's felt over all these years comes rushing out.  But he does end up channeling it in some useful way, and becomes quite a leader.  Strangely enough, he doesn't get picked to be a Prefect, like Percy once was.  (There is a good reason for it, even though this is the Harry Potter series.  :-))  Ron does, and that's a great thing, for a loyal 'second fiddle' as he has been throughout most of the books.  But I do hope that Harry becomes Head Boy in a couple of years!Rowling does a wonderful job of bringing back some of the 'minor' characters.  Some of the students you've heard mentioned during the sorting play more of a role here.A lot of questions are answered in this book, such as why Harry has to go back to Privet Drive every year.  I have a feeling too, that the coming summer for Harry is going to be somewhat better.A word of caution.  Rowling has said in interviews that a major character is going to die.  If you don't already know who, wait to find out until you read the book for yourself.  I don't think it exactly spoiled it for me to know, but perhaps it takes away some of the emotional impact if you know in advance who's going to make it, and who isn't.  Either way, you'll love the book.",FALSE,2003,1468
"4086",4,731219,FALSE,"Of all the harry Potter Books I found this one to be the most humorous. The first six chapters are simply hilarious. Though my personal favortie remains Goblet of Fire, the most disappointing thing about Phoenix is the way Sirus Black was taken. With less explanation then when Cedric Diggory died, you would think being Harry's Godfather they would have devoted more story  to this great character. What a simple tragedy that J.K Rowlings decided it was his time to go. Devoting a simple paragraph to the end of this persons life was totally dissappointing. He deserved far more then what he received in this installment of the series, I feel he still had so much to offer Harry and the Books.In itself this book is predictable where her last four keep you on the edge all the way through, knowing who would be the one to die was easy to figure out. Also knowing it would come down to harry or the Dark Lord was easy to figure out. Four of her Books where spell binding, this one seemed to lack the punch and the mystery of the last four. We can only hope the last in the series don't fall as short as this one did.Overall it was a good read, though not what you would have expected from J.K. Rowlings after the last four master peices. What a true lose to this magical world Sirus Black had so much to offer, and was seen for only a very short time.Still a fan of these Books and Rowlings, in anticipation we wait for the next book to come out, let's hope it doesn't take as long as Phoenix did.",FALSE,2003,1498

Consequently, the evil is stronger too. It becomes more  malevolent as the kids age and themselves become more powerful. Harry at  last starts to learn, under the tutelage of professor Lupin something  useful about confronting the Dark Arts.The ""baddies"" in this  book, the are really quite scary, the Dementors the scariest  ""creatures "" yet. (Actually they are a bit reminiscent of a cross  between something from Lord of The Rings and The Power Rangers) Harry is  meant to be growing and maturing with the readership, I have read, but the  only problem with this is that as the youngest readers embark on the  adventure, they are going to continue on the journey. Not everyone in the  future will have to wait a year between publication of each volume.There is a really well-developed and clearly written time play in this  as part of the climax, and I think some of the very young readers (say 6-7  - yes, some kids as young as that are having the series read to them. I  would recommend it for bright 8 year olds up) would find much of it beyond  them.Still, a great read, and the Quidditch games are possibly the most  exciting yet!The lovely thing about the books is that despite all the  hype accompanying the publication of the 4th HP book, it was bubbling along  by the best possible method: word of mouth amongst kids themselves.Here  we enter the world of Enid Blyton with a very big difference - the English  boarding school story suffused with magic, fun and danger.  One of the  delights is that instead of privation, this school is one of bounty - no  need for secret midnight feasts when good food, feasting and celebration is  part of the regular Hogwarts experience!Harry and his friends Hermione  and Ron are terrific creations, and will remain children's classics -  deservedly so. They're terrific books to read along with the kids. I  believe young people still enjoy their parents or other adults reading  aloud with them even at the age where they could read these independently  (the target age group is about 9 to 12).

Knowing that they would fly off the shelves if I didn't grab a copy (I had heard about the book on the news that evening), I bought a copy. Not only that, but I bought a copy of each of them (I'm one of those people who, in the heat of the moment, believes that if I don't get one now, I'll never be able to!)I decided I would give them to my 8 year old niece for Christmas. Now, I heard the stories about how ""evil"" the books were supposed to be, so I decided to read the first one - just to see. I was HOOKED.I read all the books the week I bought them. I gave my niece a card and $20.00 for Christmas.Sure, these books may be the epitome of mass market publication. And you might get sick of seeing Harry Potter everywhere.

"4097",4,731195,FALSE,"I wonder if there's any point in trying not to spoil the book for the readers of this review, as most other reviews I've read give away everything.  The fact is if you read and enjoyed the previous Harry Potter books, you'd be crazy not to read this one as well.I was thrilled that the book is a whole 870 pages.  I finished my first read-through the second day after I bought it, and I would have been able to finish it sooner if I hadn't had so mny other things to do.  I don't understand anyone who would criticize this book for being too long.This book is much darker than any of the four previous books.  Harry is a troubled young man in a lot of ways.  I think that anyone who has read the series can understand that.  It was disheartening to witness his wide-eyed anxiety and spirit change in this book.  At first I didn't understand Harry's attitude changes, but then I realized two things...1. In Harry's time frame the shocking events at the conclusion of book four are a fresh memory.  Whereas I've had more than a year to deal with them, he has only had a few months.2. I'm an adult, and Harry is a teenager who is being forced to grow up much too quickly.I think that his attitude changes are realistic, and it doesn't make me love him any less.  It makes sense that those of us who enjoyed these books as a candy-coated escape from the mundane would experience some disapointment to watch it change into a more serious and tragic world.  But if Harry didn't grow up, if each book that followed were just a repeat of the same style and the same story we would quickly grow tired of it.  This book is not the most pleasant book in the series, and it's not my favorite, but it is an excellent piece of literature that I will continue to appreciate.The death that took place in this book upset me greatly, but I think I understand why Rowling did it.  It may seem at first like one more thing that poor Harry has to endure, but i have faith that Rowling knows what she's doing and that Harry is going to recover tremendously in the next book.",FALSE,2003,1474

I'll let you read the book to find out who they are and what they're doing, but I will say this, these are some of the most colorful characters Rowling has come up with yet. It also has an even darker tone to it, which seems to be increasing with each passing volume. I will say this about the book, it has one of the best climactic scenes of any book I've ever read - a battle that takes place between the forces of good and evil.I can see myself reading this book several times, just to try and catch all the things I might have missed the first go round. I read it so quickly the first time, I just wanted to know how it ended! I would suggest reading it at a leisurely pace instead of the frantic pace I had.This book makes me eagerly anticipate the 6th book in the series when it will be released in a couple of years most likely.

This one turns extremely dark and negative. One thing that keeps coming up in this book is Harry complaining all the time. The complaining is what hurts the theme of Harry Potter and since he complains so much I just wanted to throw the book away but I gave it a chance. In a way some of the chapters are written in way that is already predictable and it is just a waste of writing and time. The story flows smoothly and easy to read but it is written in a style like a movie in a way. First 4 books where written in a style like a very good story but J.K. Rowling wrote this to fit it on the movie screen. From my opinion the majority of this book is a waste of time until the ending part of the book. If you are looking for a book that is positive and fun, I would suggest pass. But if you are a die hard Potter fan this book is great for you. If you got the patience to read a fairly well written book I would suggest read it. I gave it 3 stars because this is not like any of the former 4 books at all, very, dark and negative, and I wanted a positive, good theme. It deserves some points because of the flow and the plot.

JK Rowling has a great understanding of what it is like to be a 15 year old.  In this book Harry learns about dating, learns more about his father, and learns a lot about anger. I really think that older children reading this book could easily relate to Harry and the intense feelings he has throughout the book.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix also teaches about the downside of life in a way that children can understand and relate to. The book deals with surprises, disappointments, unjust laws, corrupt government, death and unfair punishments in an excellent way.  The reader soon starts to feel bad for Harry and his classmates. In general, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a book full of tension and evolving characters.  All in all I love the book because I like the way it draws the reader into the story.

As much as I enjoyed reading ""The Chamber of Secrets"", I really didn't think that it captivated me nearly as much as ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" did. Even JK Rowlings recently admitted on tv that ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" was her favorite book to write. She even mentioned that it gave subtle hints to what to expect for the sixth Harry Potter book. I think the reason I enjoyed reading ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" so much was that it gave some glimpse into Harry's past. He is tormented by the last moments of his late mother when the dementors taunt Harry which tortures him emotionally. Overall the writing by JK Rowling was simply some of her best work I had ever read. I like the first two books and ""The Order of the Phoenix"" but I has to say she really does an amazing job on ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"". I can't wait to start reading ""The Goblet of Fire"".

"4113",5,731245,FALSE,"People who complain about the length of a book really shouldn't read books: allowing the physical thickness of a novel to detract from your enjoyment of the storyline shows that you're probably not all that interested in the story in the first place. A story should be judged on its competence, its use of language and its general enjoyment factor, and while these are very personal rules to measure, the length of a story is irrelevant because if the story is good, why should the length matter?Anyway, this fifth installment of the by-now infamous Harry Potter series sees our hero, Harry, dealing with the return of his nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and the ostracisation and disbelief of the rest of the Wizarding Community. Harry's older, wiser and more inured to violence and darkness, and this is what sets the tone of the plot. From the first few chapters on, JK Rowling quickly establishes that these are dark times for Harry, and unapologetically illustrates the plight of the boy from the initial shock of the return of Voldemort, to the final, shocking climax.My hat goes off to Rowling: it's a difficult thing to live up to hype and expectation, and to take such a brave step in her writing is no small feat. Harry is growing up quickly, learning hard lessons along the way. Gone are the heady, child-like days of the first three books, and we're left with an understandably angry teenager with more on his plate than most. He shouts (IN CAPITAL LETTERS :-) and fights and has emotional responses appropriate for his age and experiences. She may have alienated a part of her audience who are caught up in the hype of the Harry Potter Series For Kids - this is a clear and marked departure from that tone of writing. Harry, Hermione and Ron all have new depth and characteristics, while retaining the old ones that we love them for.She introduces a host of new characters, too, the most memorable of which is Delores Umbridge, a hateful and vitriolic woman whose powermongering almost causes the death of our central characters. Memorable, too, is Nymphadora Tonks, a young and vivacious witch who provides some much-needed comic relief at various points in the novel. There's also a wonderful sense of resolution with characters like the Weasley parents, and Snape - their personalities are more carefully illustrated here than in previous novels. Finally, we discover exactly why Snape hates Harry so much. Dumbledore is made more human in this novel, and through this we begin to understand why he cares so much about Harry.The narrative is set at a slower pace, with more time and description devoted to what the characters are feeling, instead of driving the events. The plot comes together towards the very end of the novel, by which point we have a fully-realised set of central characters, and we understand their reactions during the climactic scenes better.Harry, and JK Rowling's initial audience, is growing up. This book is the fifth in a series where you do need to start at the beginning in order to appreciate the later novels. It's darker and more adult than previous works, but then again, so is Harry.

Harry spends most of his time being a reactive protagonist, rather than a proactive one, either waiting around for attacks or reacting against the limitations placed on his mobility for his own safety by the Hogwarts administration. The central plot does pick up speed and demand focus in the last third of the book, but until then a lot of empty space is filled with numerous tiny subplots, all of which are quite entertaining.  As Rowling has demonstrated in the previous novels, she does a remarkable job of tying up absolutely every subplot by the end of the story in a way that makes them all integral to each other. No subplot could be removed from the book without the entire story collapsing. A lot of coincidental events are required to make the novel work, but she manages to set up the coincidences so that they do seem to unfold naturally in the narrative. The book is a lot of fun and a signifcant year for Potter, as many things are revealed about the circumstances surrounding the death of his parents.

Two new  teachers are introduced at Hogwarts, Professor Lupin and Professor  Trelawney both rich in uniqueness and fun to read about.  A new pet,  Crookshanks is introduced and is central to the storyline.  A terrifying  new thing are the dementors that are the guards of Azkaban, removed to look  for the escaped Sirius.  Harry has quite a few harrowing encounters with  these creatures. Hermione has a strange year as she tries to take too many  courses for a normal student, alas, she was never a normal student.

It's easy to cheat, to only give the necessary clue at the very end, but a good mystery novel doesn't cheat.J.K. Rowling doesn't cheat. She gives all the clues to deciphering the mystery of Rita Skeeter in book 4, but I never put them together.  It's one reason her novels are so good. The second and third time through you can still see small clues she gave you, in a very fair, open fashion, but which slipped by you at the time.  It's also a reason why the books have such high re-read value.  On a second read, you can look for the clues she dropped that slipped by you the first time or look for how she drops them, the voice she uses, so you can hunt for where else she uses that voice in the series.Order of the Phoenix, more than previous books, begins to answer the mysteries that shroud Harry Potter's future and past, even as it sets Harry's feet firmly on the path to book 7.There are questions left from the previous books: Why did Voldemort try to kill Harry's parents? Was it simple malice? What does the dialogue 'take me instead!' mean? Why would someone think they had a choice? Why would they think they could negotiate with Voldemort? Then there are hints of things to come: why did Dumbeldore's eyes light with triumph in the fourth book when he discovered that Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his ritual? Does this mean Voldemort shares Harry's fate?What better tribute to the series' success than the websites that raise these questions?Without ruining any of the details of Phoenix, it continues this tradition. There is also the pleasure of seeing old friends: Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, et. al.To read Phoenix, you also need to know that every one knew that a major character would die in this book.  English bookmakers were taking odds on which character it would be and Rowling teases the reader with this throughout the book.Phoenix is beautifully done, a pleasure to read.  As always, it makes you wonder what she's laid out that you're not seeing.  It leave questions, unanswered mysteries, but it is, even so, very satisfying.Highly recommended, to adults and children.",FALSE,2004,1758

Harry, now a 15-year-old, has some of the wilfulness of most teenagers, but retains his desire to protect the world from the evil that continually hunts him.This time, however, even the Ministry of Magic is against him, Dumbledore, and all who believe that Voldemort has returned.  Hogwarts itself is besieged by the Ministry's minions which hampers everyone's efforts in the fight against the Dark Lord.  There is always Professor Snape, who hates Harry more than he hates Voldemort.

There have been some reviews saying that the books suck.  Well then I totally recommend getting the audio book versions.  Jim Dale acts out the book with wonderful voices.  His voice is very soothing and his acting superb.  You finally get a real feeling of who the characters are.  I tend to be a skim-reader and I never get to soak myself into each word.  The audio book brought out the double layer meanings and the emotions felt by Harry.I can see where people feel that this book was repetitive.  Yes, Harry is seriously confused in this book.  But you have to realize, he's a young boy with no parents to explain to him what he feels.  Also, he has a streak of pride which is only a part of the well-rounded character.  It's really amazing how well Rowling writes about a boy going through so many things that most young child would never go through.  His emotional state is so convincing, so real (even if it gets a little annoying or frustrating at times).  Can you remember being a teen?  I was totally confused and TOTALLY frustrating to my mother.Though I never lived in the era where radio was the best form of entertainment, I can see why people were so captured by programs like these audio books.  I've even seen an improvement in the vocabulary I use everyday.  So I definitely recommend this book and definitely the audio book.5 stars for the book and 6 stars for the audio book!

"4126",5,731191,FALSE,"In terms of pure enjoyment ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" ranks alongside only a handful of other books I have ever read, and it certainly meets the expectations raised by the first four books.  It is also more interesting than the first four books due to the fact that it more sinister and more grownup.  The story is beginning to morph out of childhood and into adulthood and is shedding some of the childish simplicity of the first four books.  If the trend continues then book seven will hardly be a children's book at all.  This is not a bad thing, however.In spite of the increasingly complex and dark world that Harry occupies, however, I found myself on at least a half dozen occasions slapping my mattress (I read while lying in my bed) while guffawing.  There is some good humor here, half of it due to Rowling's insights into the minds of fifteen year olds, and half due to her imagination which I consider perhaps the most fascinating one I have ever encountered.  Tolkien had a strong imagination also, but it was not quite as mischevous and mirthful as Rowling's and The Lord of the Rings often gets bogged down by pages of imaginative description that perhaps only Tolkien himself could really appreciate.  Rowling's imagination, on the other hand, is light, humourous, and has a more universal appeal.I do have a few minor complaints about the book.  These are in no way serious enough to merit a rating less than 5 stars, but I think they are worth mentioning.1) Evil in this book is a caricature.  It is ugly, loves to torture, and is too easily recognized.  Why would anyone want to be a Death Eater if all you do is snivel at the feet of Voldemort?  Where is the perfumed, sultry, sexy appeal of evil?2) We need more on Voldemort. As the series becomes more epic and mythic it begins to feel a bit lopsided as only Harry Potter is fully developed.  (The Lord of The Rings suffered from this problem as well -- Sauron was never explained or developed satisfactorily while we got a lot of the history of hobbits.) Where did Voldemort come from? (I mean metaphysically, not biologically). He appears not to be merely a Dumbledore who has capitulated to evil.  There is something more going on here and it was not fleshed out whatsoever in this novel.3) We need more of the big picture about this world.  What are the overarching principles?  Where do the dead go when they die (a question Harry himself asks in this book)?  What is the grounding for good and evil?  On what does Dumbledore base his knowledge (what is his epistemology)? Why is Harry not in danger of capitulating to evil himself?  Is Harry merely born destined to Good while Voldemort was born destined to Evil?  I hope this world is not that simplistic!  Why shouldn't Harry just join Voldemort, take over the world, then out-manuever and kill Voldemort, and then rule the world?  It is not good enough merely to say that this would be bad -- we need to know why this would be bad.  Why is evil evil and not good?  These bedrock principles need to be fleshed out.",FALSE,2003,1470
"4127",5,730407,FALSE,"I didn't think I'd like this book as well as the others. I mean, how many times can you bring the Dark Lord into Harry Potter's life before it becomes trite and far-fetched? As usual, by prejudging this book based on Rowling's past work, I did myself a huge disservice. This book was fantastic.Now, I did guess a big part of it - my real first triumph in the world of Harry Potter. However, I missed the ending entirely. Yet, it was an ending that made the most sense. You never feel cheated in a book when the author ends it the way you would if you had the reins. Well, I might not have seen the path had I been driving, but once I laid eyes on it, I saw it to be natural and perfect.All I can say here is that the books are getting continually better. Rowling adds to the description and emotions of the characters, injecting charm and humor in surprising abundance. It is almost as though the scope of the story is growing with each book. Kind of like since Harry is getting older, growing up, we are able to see a fuller world with more depth and reality than when he was just eleven. This is especially true in the fourth novel, which I will get to later.New characters are introduced. Some frightening, some friendly, but all interesting. The Dementors are especially memorable. You cheer for Harry as never before. This is the first book where I felt that Harry was special, maybe stronger than your typical wizard. I think he will eventually rise to a special place in the world of witches and wizards and I'm looking forward to that. But the great thing about this book is that the things you hope will happen, the things you scream to happen, do happen.Once again, I looked down and found myself soaring high through the magical world, pulled there masterfully by a great writer with a brilliant imagination. I hope the series continues beyond the seven planned books. I hope there will be a few adult adventures of Harry Potter. There would be nothing more endearing than growing up with a character and then finding him fully grown in one's own adulthood. Rowling is already touching the hearts and minds of children and adults everywhere. But once his time at Hogwarts has passed, I think it would be intriguing to see how the boy gets along as a man.Buy this book. You won't be disappointed.",FALSE,2001,686

The dark hand of the frightening Dementor guards of Azkaban surround the outer gates of Hogwarts in hopes of capturing Black before they can attack Harry. Harry, Ron and Hermione face new tests of their friendship. The three encounter new teachers like the brilliant Professor Lupin. Lupin has a mysterious illness that Harry suspects Snape has an sinister hand in perpetuating so he can steal the headmaster position of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Prisoner of Azkaban offers fun new places to visit, new people and creatures to encounter, and we furthur shed light on the mystery of the deadly encounter between Voldemort and Harry's parents. This book has some of the most exciting twists and turns yet.  J.K. Rowlings outdoes herself with this book.

"4133",5,730779,FALSE,"I'm not a kid anymore.  I'm an adult now.  But somewhere in between childhood and adulthood a curse was cast upon me.  I stopped reading.  I used to read all sorts of books when I was young (if Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys sound familiar to you, then you'll know roughly how old I am).  I read whatever I could get a hold of and it filled me with a sense of wonder and imagination.  Reading filled voids during the lonely times, and gave me something to think about during the happy times.It's kind of ironic that a children's book should make me fall in love with reading again.  But this book did the trick.  From Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I slowly read the next book in the series, then the next and the next.  Each book got progressively thicker, but that didn't matter.  The stories come to life with humorous characters and this world of witchcraft and wizardry.  I was beginning to imagine again!After reading the four books in the series, I said to myself ""Hey, that wasn't so bad.  I wonder why I stopped reading.""  From that point on, I started with The Hobbit, then The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien.  Then I saw the movie trailer for The Bourne Identity which stars Matt Damon and I looked for the book it was based on.  That led me to explore the world of espionage and international conspiracies according to Robert Ludlum.  From here, I realized that I should probably balance my reading between fiction and non-fiction.  So I read Good to Great, a business book by Jim Collins (the author of Built to Last), Jack: Straight from the Gut (about Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE), Made in America (about Sam Walton, the founder of WalMart).  With a seamingly endless sea of titles to choose from and written by authors I did not know, I started one book at a time from each ""famous"" (atleast to the world around me) author.  I've read current books by John Grisham, Jonathan Kellerman, Sandra Brown, Carol Higgins Clark, Robin Cook, Tess Gerritsen, and many many more.  From this sampling, I've developed a sense of what I like and don't like.  I've discovered what ""formulas"" these authors use.  All this in a span of 5 months.I don't even realize how caught up I get when I describe to my friends the books I've read and the books I plan to read.

Nearly every story that ever came out about witchcraft and wizardry before Harry Potter made it look like an evil part of our world.  But JKR changed it, giving witchcraft and wizardry their own place to live.  Her stuff is original and wonderful.I would rather read stuff by JKR then I would by other authors listed in some of the bad reviews.  Those book were too, oh... non-daring.  They stayed almost ""politically correct.""  Harry Potter is away from the norm.  It is a very daring novel, especially coming out in today's day and age.And as to the Satan thing?  I highly doubt it.  JKR herself has suggested that the books actually have many pro-religious morals hidden within them.This particular book, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is undoubtebly JKR's best work so far.

Being enjoyed by tabloid writers, he is now pictured as a lunatic, struggling in his subjects in school plus the continues blasts from the press. He though finds strength in his friends to overcome this evil and finally succeeds and escapes again from certain death brought forth by the Dark Lord. This chapter of Harry's life is one that is darker and more mature. Here,we see the wholeness of the series starting to take shape, answering questions left unanswered after closing the previous books in the series. As Harry is brighter and braver, the growing threat of the antagonist also grows more vile than before. Voldemort, now equipped with a body, possessess our hero!! Also, the book takes twists into showing how unreliable the once honored Ministry of Magic is. The school also, which was once a beacon of hope, now falls into evil's hands and itself is faced into decay with the sitting of the new headmaster bent on making Harry's life hell, thus preventing his message of Voldemort's return impossible to be announced. The richest book, yes I think so. The characters are well written and come alive with vivid descriptions. More adult themes appear in this book, pain, anger, and rebellion.

You won't want to miss a word.The  third installment in the series is far and away the best (so far), full of  surprises and twists.

"4142",5,731195,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, is the third book in the Harry Potter series (as if I had to tell you that).  I've read the first book and seen the second movie, but I decided that I wanted to see what this phenomenon was all about for myself.  As with the first book, I found Prisoner to be a thoroughly charming tale, filled with wonder, suspense, interesting writing and fun characters.  It was a fitting sequel to the first two stories.First of all, Prisoner is the last of the ""short"" Harry Potter books (with the next two books weighing very hefty on the page scale), but its story doesn't seem to suffer at all.  Rowling packs a lot of story into so few pages.  The pace is fairly relentless.  I think it does suffer a little bit, though, from the beginning.  As with the first two stories, the Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia scenes seem a little pointless and tacked on.  The sequence doesn't seem to have a lot of purpose other than to get the ball rolling.  While they aren't bad scenes and I did enjoy them a little bit, I kept waiting for the action to start.  I hope that they start getting development beyond the typical ""snarky family who hates Harry for what he is and wants to keep him down"" portrayal we've seen so far.  But this book doesn't do it.Once things get started, though, the tale becomes much more interesting as Rowling adds to the rich background of the universe she's created.  She keeps adding new things and characters to her world, and each one of them is intriguing.  The story behind Sirius Black and what happened with Harry's parents is fascinating, and the twists and turns this particular story takes are particularly good.  As events come to their conclusion, you're riveted to your seat as you want to find out what really happened (I read the last hundred pages in one night, staying up much too late).  There is also a nice moral point for the kids (who are the primary audience for these books, despite them being wonderful books for adults too) where the correction of one injustice is used to correct another one as well.  This makes a wonderful point about injustice and how one must fight against it, no matter who is perpetrating it.I found Hermione's story very predictable, though.  I figured out what was going on with her the first time the question came up.  Rowling does dovetail it nicely with the main story though, giving it a purpose rather than just showing how eccentric Hermione can be sometimes.  I didn't like the antipathy between Hermione and Ron as much, though.  I thought it was a bit overdone.  I know it is realistic in the sense that kids can hold grudges over the most minor of things sometimes, but I didn't find it that pleasant to read about in this case.  I had trouble seeing how Hermione couldn't understand that Ron was upset that her cat kept attacking his rat.  At least the antipathy grew from their already established characters, so that was nice.  Most of the other things they quarrel about are rules-related, and with Hermione being such a stickler for the rules and with the added pressure of her schedule, it is a bit understandable that there would be friction.The two new professors, Lupin and Trelawney, are a mixed bag.  Lupin is wonderful, with an intriguing secret and an interesting interaction with Harry.  He becomes almost like a mentor to him, and one starts to wonder if there are sinister motives behind it all.  Lupin was also involved with Harry's parents, and the reader is left to wonder throughout the story whether or not Lupin is on the up and up.  Telawney, on the other hand, I found dreadfully boring.  The only thing of interest she did was predict Harry's imminent death, but every time she appeared on the page after that, I almost started snoring.  She was annoying, too, with all of her ""oh, I predicted that"" statements.  She got on my nerves after awhile, and I don't think Rowling did a good job characterizing her.  She could have played an important part in the book, but Rowling drops the ball a little bit.Finally, the Dementors and the description of Azkaban prison are really well-done.  The mystery behind them and their effect on Harry, the fear and awe they inspire in everybody, is just incredibly done.  There is a real sense of menace with them, especially when Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster of the school, won't allow them on to school grounds.  Harry really grows up when he ultimately has to face them.  I don't think I'd want to see much more about them, but their presence in this book was extremely satisfying.  These are supposed to be ""the good guys,"" but they're more feared then Sirius Black, I think.  That's what makes them interesting.I was a bit surprised at the tone of the book.  It seemed pretty dark for a so-called children's book.  I've been surprised by the first two stories as well, but this was even a little bit darker than those.  Children are obviously lapping these books up, though, and apparently reading them and loving them, so I guess I'm wrong about that.  If I had children though, I'd definitely want to make sure my children were ready for these before I gave them the books.  However, on the upside, the ""adult"" writing makes it a wonderful story for all ages.  If you enjoyed the first two, you can't go wrong with this one either.David Roy",FALSE,2003,1474

However, his major relationships are maintained.We learn more about the school days of James and Lily Potter, and a lot more about Professor Snape.Mrs. Weasley gets one of her dearest wishes early on.A major character does die, but I found this death to be less surprising than the death in Goblet of Fire.  No less sad, but less surprising.We learn a lot more of the inner workings of the Ministry of Magic, and it may be slow going at times, but the action always picks up in a few more pages..Dumbledore finally tells Harry why he has to spend at least part of the summer with the Dursleys.This is the first book in the series, in my opinion, that really cannot be read without reading the others first.And yes, there is a new Defense Against The Dark Arts professor, and it's not a good one like Professor Lupin, who reappears in this book.",FALSE,2003,1468

I had a ton of third graders eagerly awaiting this book and not all of them were mature enough to handle it.  If your student is above 5/6th grade, no worries.The book furthers the plot line, and takes some of the polish off the wizarding world.  If there is an issue I have with the first couple books, it's how perfect everything is (for the most part) is in the wizarding world.  Sure they've had their problems, but with Dumbledore and the Ministry standing guard, nothing too horrific could happen again.  In this book we see Dumbledore, harry's parents, and the ministry as more fallible, potentially corruptible entities.

"4147",5,731216,FALSE,"Harry Potter has been the subject of two previous novels, and they all start the same way. In each, Harry's suffering through an abominable summer with his relatives, the repulsive Dursleys, who hate and fear him (because of his magical powers) and have worked their whole lives to spoil their son and torment Harry. This time around, Harry's aunt visits them, and treats him even worse than the Dursleys themselves do, and Harry becomes angry. The result isn't pretty and could get him in trouble, but instead he's whisked away to a safe haven to wait for school to start, largely because there's a magical fugitive on the loose, and the rumor is he's going to try and kill Harry.This third of Rowling's Harry Potter series is a bit longer than the first two, but not as intimidating as the later two (which each top 800 pages). It's significantly more mature in its messages. I don't mean sex, but there are lessons here about trying to do too much, trying to do the right things, and so forth, that are worth reading even if you aren't a kid. The plot's also a bit more sophisticated and complex, and I think a bit better. If anything, it's an improvement over the first two books, and very interesting.",FALSE,2003,1495
"4149",4,731187,FALSE,"<spoilers>Like Rowling's previous books in the series, it was extremely hard to put down.  Even when I haven't read a book in a long while, Rowling always brings me back full force, wanting more.During this 5th installment, Harry is wracked with guilt, anger, and petty jealousy.  In addition to being a normal 15 year-old teenager, he has to deal with the painful memories of the death of Cedric Diggory (book 4) and the return of Voldemort.  Only his closest friends and supporters even believe his story regarding Voldemort and this leads to an increased feeling of helplessness throughout the book.  He rages at these feelings and channels them into all sorts of rebellous acts.This is definitely not the boy from Book 1.  The wide-eyed innocence of the magic world has lost its luster and is replaced by feelings of loss and frustration.  It's hard to reconcile these differences but it's quite understandable considering the immense burden he is forced to bear.Although I enjoyed this book, there were times that I felt a little helpless myself.  As Harry, time after time, does the wrong thing and continually refuses to listen to the advice of his friends and loved ones, the story becomes almost infuriating.  And even as we find out in the end why Dumbledore chose to keep Harry in the dark, I just had to say, huh?  It didn't seem like a good reason to me.  The infallibility of Dumbledore is definitely brought into question on this one.  And why exactly is this prophecy so important?  What could Voldemort have gained with it?  It's so vague as to be nearly useless.In addition, the other characters in the book become a mere background story as Harry's persona takes over every page.  The story of Ron finally overcoming his fears and winning the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor is told and then completely forgotten.  Any romance between him and Hermione is at a complete standstill (other than one kiss on the cheek she gives him).  Hagrid is barely in the book and when he does appear, he seems totally self-absorbed.  Past characters of Lupin and Mad-Eye Moody are little more than background noise.  A little time is given to Sirius, but, because of the what happens later in the book, it didn't seem like near enough.A few new characters where brought out in this book, namely Umbridge, Luna Lovegood, and Tonks.  Umbridge was thoroughly repulsive and made a good villian (although I couldn't really feel scared of her at all...her character was more ridiculous than fearful).  Luna came out of nowhere to become a semi-central character yet I still have no real idea about who she is and what drives her.  I rather doubt she will even show up much in the last two books.  Tonks is an interesting character but nothing was ever really done with her...maybe in one of the next books we'll find out more.One of my favorites, Neville, seems to receive more book time than either Ron on Hermione.  I surely thought a nasty death was coming to him because of this.  I was relieved that he survived but it actually would have been a much more heartbreaking loss had he been the one who died in the end.  I felt far greater sympathy for him than for Sirius...who has always seemed to be a tertiary character to me.Another quick item was the burgeoning romance between Harry and Cho Chang.  So much time was spent on building this relationship, only to have it summarily thrown away at the end of the book.  As far as I could tell, they still liked each other very much but, for some reason, Cho just decides to start going out with other people?  And Harry didn't even seem to care?  I thought that very strange.All in all, a great book and a real page turner.

His growing frustration at the Ministry of Magic's refusal to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned is taking its toll on him and the lack of communication from his friends and allies are only adding fuel to the fire.  To top it off, this year at Hogwarts are the Ordinary Wizarding Level Exams, which put to the test all of Harry's knowledge and skill.  Given all this, it is no surprised that Harry is on edge through the entire book and his perils are more severe than they have ever been.

Harry, and we with him, lose a lot of innocence in this book, and it is as hard a transition for Harry as it was for we adults who are, at least theoretically, past that. Some children will have problems with it.With Philosopher's Stone, Harry Potter earned a place in our hearts. We turned a corner in ""Goblet of Fire"" and Harry's world changed.

It is overwhelming at times, a feeling made worse when you realize that there wasn't a big plot; if anything, this was written partially for contract, partially to continue the story (I, personally, could have lived without the whole Hagrid/Grawp subplot, not to mention 50% of Dolores Umbridge, who herself is part pun, part metaphor, yet neither part really does anything but make one groan).But one thing to be said, there is growing tension and suspense in the book, which is written and intended--if we remember for a moment and think (perhaps somewhat naively)--for young adults and not those of us with seasoned palates.  This is why the book deserves a high rating; to me--and to many individuals over the age of, say, 16--this isn't a great novel.  But it is an excellent novel for the young adult crowd and anyone who wants a mystery/fantasy/pseudo-thriller with characters who are reaching the genesis of their development.  We may not like the person Harry becomes or the browbeating attitude of Umbridge or Ron's jealousy rearing its head at odd turns, but it is a realistic portrayal of adolescent confusion and angst, of the tendency for some individuals in today's society to repress information and punish anyone who tries to resist the ""system.""Yes, this is a heavy-handed statement, but this book is a metaphor as much as it is a fantasy.  Remember, the Harry Potter series is desgined as an arc, so we naturally have to have the stage set for the final two books in the saga.Hardcore Potter fans will enjoy this.  Anyone expecting a great epic, however, will be disappointed because of their misconceptions.But, if you shelve your misconceptions as I was able to, you will come away from ""The Order of the Phoenix"" with a greater appreciation for Rowling's ability to tell a story and keep her readers on the edges of their seats, biting their nails and asking themselves ""could this be who dies?""Until Book Six, I suppose we'll have to read this again.  Hopefully then we'll see who Harry decides to become involved with in a more intimate level.",FALSE,2003,1523
"4157",4,731544,FALSE,"JK Rowling set herself a difficult task when she began a series that would culminate and end in adolescence.  It's easy enough to write glowingly of the adventures of children, like Rowling did particularly in the first couple of books.  But it was clear from Book One that these children would grow up, and the dangers they face would become increasingly serious.  And so they have.The major threat in Book Five doesn't come only from the purely evil Lord Voldemort but also from mistakes made by characters on Harry's side of the fight.  Sirius, Harry's father (in flashback), and Dumbledore all show themselves to be fallible, while many readers will find themselves feeling true sympathy for Snape for the first time.Similarly, the plot is driven mainly by Harry's frustrations with the restrictions he faces, rather than immediate mortal peril.  Harry feels like he should be given more responsibility because of all he accomplished, but more and more restrictions are piled on him as the story progresses - it's any teenager's worst nightmare writ large.  Because the book is mostly built around Harry dealing with growing up rather than winning a series of exciting fights, the plot sometimes feels a bit meandering.  I remained riveted the whole time, but I did sometimes wonder where it was going.There is a big action sequence at the end, and it's long and thrilling and seriously dangerous.  But it could have been avoided if the ""good"" characters had better communication with one another, so for the first time, blame for the injuries (and death) doesn't fall squarely on Voldemort.  This makes the losses more difficult to bear, but for the first time Rowling directly addresses the afterlife as well, deftly inserting some comforting answers that aren't specific to any religion.Overall, this is a far more nuanced and adult book than the first four, and is well-suited to Harry's emerging adulthood.  It's still safe territory for Harry's younger fans but will likely find more appreciation from the early-teen through adult set and provides a great opportunity for those who started reading Harry Potter when the first book came out to truly grow up along with Harry.",FALSE,2004,1823

Fans have been waiting three years for its appearance, and are even now hacking their way through it and posting comments and questions on the Internet.  I will try to avoid specific spoilers while saying what I have to say: this book mildly disappointed me.It was thrilling enough to read through it, mind.  Any new Harry Potter after so long is better than no Harry Potter at all.  And a few of the mysteries I've been wondering about for so long have been solved at long last.  But it seemed to me that, in the end, the book just didn't hang together very well.  There were several subplots that suddenly appeared out of nowhere, then vanished back into nowhere just as suddenly, and certain events at the climax left some things to be desired.That being said, it is still a Harry Potter book, and Rowling continues to have an amazing talent for leavening the storyline's increasing darkness with aptly-placed cathartic humor, and for making various little details revealed in prior books take on a much greater significance in this newer context.

The book weighs in at almost 900 pages, but the story could have been told in about 600. J.K. Rowling has reached the stage in her career where she no longer has to listen to what editors have to say. This is not usually a good thing, and, in this case, leads to a lot of unnecessary, poorly-paced prose and more than a few plot dead ends.That said, though, there is plenty in _The Order of the Pheonix_ of what appeals to Harry Potter fans generally. The general plot is every bit as exciting as other Potter books, and the characters are growing up and starting to act like teenagers. Rowling does a good job of revealing some of the plot mysteries of the overall story cycle without tipping her hat too much. I'm defininitely glad that I read the book, and I have no problem reading a 900 page book with a 900 page story to tell.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an exceptional story and more than worth the wait. A lot of the questions that have arisen with the series are answered in the book and the overall story is much clearer paving the way to the final two installments. Actually, my only complaint relates to that ... only two more to go! But then all good stories must come to the end. While an 8th which goes out of the series storyline might work, what I'd like to see from Rowling as much as a new series as captivating as her first would be an exhaustive and bicep building edition of Hogwarts: A History. If book seven is going to be the end, such a publication would make for a nice crowning touch to cap off the series and the Harry Potter universe. As others have stated, the fifth book is much tighter than the previous editions. So much so that the story would suffer to cut much of anything from it. What doesn't relate directly to the story at hand, surely foreshadows the story to come as it has in Rowling's previous editions.

"4163",4,731526,FALSE,"In the fifth book of the Harry Potter series, The Order of the Phoenix, J.K. Rowling once again takes readers on a magical adventure with the book's protagonist, Harry Potter.  The fifth book continues the story of Harry Potter's life as the famed hero of the wizard world.  It starts out with the familiar scene of Harry at the Dudley residence, but by the end of the first chapter Harry is met with his first challenge of the story.`""He could smell the dementor's putrid, death-cold breath, filling his lungs, drowning him-Think...something happy...But there was no happiness in him...The dementor's icy fingers were closing on his throat-the high-pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head-""Bow to death Harry...It might be painless... I would not know... I have never died...""'The dementors have invaded the one place where Harry had not known magic to be: his summer home, Little Whinging.  Not only that, but Harry had used magic to protect himself, and he was underage. So, in one chapter Harry manages to get attacked, and expelled, yet, little does he know that that's just the beginning of his problems.  Through his most demanding school year thus far, Harry is tormented by the newest defense against the Dark Arts teacher, ignored by his friend and mentor, Professor Dumbledore, banned from Quidditch, and thrown on an emotional rollercoaster with his new found attitude and love life.The Harry Potter books preceding this new installment are, in comparison; more focused on Harry's struggle against evil then the fifth book, which is more focused on developing Harry's character.  The book gives many more details on Harry's family and his enemy's.  The danger that Harry will come to face in his future becomes clearer and more perilous.  He forms a stronger bond with his friends and a stronger understanding of himself.  For example, there was never an in depth description of Harry's love life until the fifth book, where Harry goes on a date and gets his first kiss.  There is also a portion of the book that is dedicated to explaining how being alone frustrates Harry and how the fame that he has come to receive, be it good or bad, is finally starting to effect him.One of the bad things about this book is that it is much longer then the others, meaning that getting to the big action takes a lot of time.  Harry stays at the Order of the Phoenix before school, so for about two chapters Harry isn't even at school yet.  Harry also goes to the Order for Christmas, when in the other books he had stayed at the castle, and that also makes the book long-winded. So, by the time you get to the really good part, then it takes the protagonist forever to get to where he's going, which gets frustrating.  Another bad part of the story is that many of the good characters exit the story because they are hurt or banned.  These characters include Hagrid, Professor Mcgonagall, and Professor Dumbledore.The book does have it's low points, but I think that over-all it is a must read for the fans of the Harry Potter stores.  Yet, if you were to read this book without reading the others that come before it, then you would be completely lost, and the book would not be worth the time.  Each of the books builds up to the next, and the plot depends on the former information from the previous books.

The other 4 books were great. This is just a mediocre followup.With tremendous buildup in the pages, the book just doesn't pay off. I was left shaking my head, since things that definitely should have been explained were unexplained and issues that could have been left were overextended.Rowling is a good writer, and her images are still amazing and her characters are good. But there is too much YELLING and bold type in the book; Harry has made a drastic change in his character that is never explained.A key flaw in the novel is that the new annoying character, Umbridge, is too annoying. I almost stopped reading because I hated her so much. That's a mark of a good writer that I had that much emotion about it, but still, you don't want to chase your readers away.The big death that everyone is hearing about is horribly anti-climactic, and the ending of the novel is a big disappointment (whatever happened to having a payoff for reading 870 pages? And I'm an avid reader).If you've read the first four, you'll of course want to read this so you know what's happening, but if Harry didn't already have a following, Rowling wouldn't get one from this piece of overextended, somewhat plotless literature.",FALSE,2003,1475

The fifth book is lovely as all others. It hasn't lost its magic or touch, yet it's never ending plot and beginning could be a cause for many to stop reading it at times. After a few chapters I grew bored waiting for Harry to at last attend Hogwarts, and finally took a several month break from the book with my frustration.But I finally finished it and decided it was all worth it. Harry seems more of a normal teenager, with hormonal surges and outbursts. Sometimes the story grew frustrating and nerve-wrecking, but of course there were some very touching, dark scenes as well.

This third book, entitled ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", follows Harry's life when he is 13 years old and preparing to attend his third year of studies at Hogwarts.  Before the beginning of the third term, Harry must endure another summer away from his magical friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and live with his ever-unpleasant Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley.  Unfortunately, things only get worse with the announcement that his Aunt Marge is coming for a weeklong visit.  Aunt Marge makes life even more miserable than ever for Harry, even though he and Uncle Vernon have made a deal that if Harry ""behaves himself"" while Marge is there, that Uncle Vernon will sign a permission slip so that Harry, with his friends, can visit the village of Hogsmeade, the only completely wizard village in England.  However, on Aunt Marge's last night, Harry can't take any more and accidentally causes her to inflate like a balloon.  Fearing that he will be expelled or even sent to the dreaded Azkaban Prison, Harry decides to run away from the Dursleys to wait his final week prior to the start of third year.

The primary plot line with Sirius Black is very engaging, as are the several subplots which include Hagrid's hippogriff named Buckbeak, Hermione's heavy class load, Hermione's cat, Griffindore's quidditch matches, Draco Malfoy being as bad as ever, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher named Professor Remus Lupin, Harry's introduction to divination with Professor Trelawney, the trips to Hogsmeade and Fred & George Weasleys' gift to Harry.

The tension, confusion & mixture of Harry's 2 worlds blend in a richer tone & yet a more beguiling read.  Harry's life no longer revolves on quidditch (although we all know how much he longed for his Firebolt) but took a more matured turn with the foundation of the secret organization, with him being the head.The story has an 'open-ended' ending, preparing the readers for an 'open' & 'all-out-war' against the Dark Lord & his followers on the last remaining installments.  & if Book 5 has kept you reading for hours, I anticipate Books 6 & 7 would command as much (if not more) attention.I am looking forward to the next installments.

All of the books have funny parts, but the third book has some of the best moments, like when Harry goes on the Knight Bus and Snape finds the Marauder's Map and Hermione meets the boggart.

What Ms. Rowling has created is in every way as deep and rich and classic as Lord of the Rings, just in a different way.

They succeed, and it comes to a head when Aunt Marge, makes a surprise visit to 4 Privet Drive.  She is the sister of Uncle Vernon, a witch in her own right, one of the muggle variety, so mean that she makes Harry's guardians look like domesticated wildcats.  Being on his best behavior will be a real challenge, so much that his uncle strikes up a deal to sign a release form for Harry to visit Hogsmead, a weekend getaway for all third years.From the moment Aunt Marge walks in the front door of the Dursley home, the temptation to turn her into a toad becomes a very enticing alternative; however, Harry chooses to inflate her like a balloon to the reader's delight.  Although it is a well-deserved punishment for the old hag, Harry knows that it is time to fly the coup while his uncle tends to his soaring full-of-hot-air sister.Fleeing the Dursley home does not land Harry out of trouble, but smack dab in the middle of it, because lurking in the shadows is an escaped murderer of incredible notoriety, Sirius Black.  Not only did Black breakout of Azkaban, he fled from the clutches of the dementors, a seemingly impossible feat.

Harry, Hermione and Ron are still the main characters and we still follow their development faithfully, along with supporting characters like Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape.

I don't, of course, mean lengthwise (as the book was 870 pages long) but in her wording. Her writing style used to have a sort-of ""edge of my seat"", creativeness to it. At the end of the book, I knew I had loved the story, but I wasn't quite as stunned (no pun intended) as I was after the other books. I do think that some of the editors should have noticed this in the print, but I guess not. I still love Harry and the gang, though. In this book, Harry has changed. He is a bit edgier, more sarcastic, and a little meaner. Some people are complaining that Harry is becoming non-likable, but Rowling has decided that Harry would grow up in the 5th installment of the series. At age 15, we all went through the same changes. Harry couldn't stay the naive, playful person that he used to be because then it wouldn't be realistic. Harry has a big load on his shoulders and he's starting to show that. In fact, the maturity of all the children characters has started to show.

His adolescent problems, and those of his friends, are well-handled and convincing, and Rowling's not afraid to make him uptight, irritable, and just plain obnoxious at times...all in keeping with typical teenage behavior, of course. The romantic feelings of the maturing Hogwart's students are drawn from real life and well-depicted.This said, I have one major complaint with the book, and that of course is its length - it's probably too big by about 150-200 pages. Rowling's attempts to have a major plot going on inside Hogwart's, and another going on outside at the same time, adds up to way too much verbiage and gets in the way of telling a tougher, tauter story. There's too much going on, and she should, I think, have concentrated more on one story or the other. I personally would have made the outside story the main one, and events inside the school secondary. Part of this problem is due to the attention paid to Dolores Umbridge, who while a terrific villainness, takes up too much of the story at the school, especially for a character who ends up being summarily dismissed in the end.I also had some problems with the whole buildup to the discovery of the Prophecy, which seemed to have a pretty weak payoff. It wasn't nearly as earth-shattering as we were led to believe it would be during the course of the story, and was a major weak point in the plot.I did enjoy Fred and George's antics, as usual, and their departure was suitably flamboyant - it made sense in context of the plot and the development of the story in general, as well as accurately reflecting what we've come to know of their characters. And boy, are they characters!All in all, I enjoyed this book, but can't consider it one of the better books in the series.

I bought the first one to take a peek at what the furor was about and I have not looked back.  Books 1-3 were clever and fun and I thought Book 4 was phenomenal.  With that in mind, I found this 5th installment of the Harry series to be rather sadistic, frustrating, and one of the least satisfying to date.  But that didn't stop me from flying through the book.  It's a fast read and there are some moments of pure delight and magic...but I was disappointed overall in the effort.  For starters, the tone is all so dark and Harry is angry throughout the whole thing.  It's a bit hard to take.  Also, the story line involving Cho Chang does not ring true at all.  How can Harry be so obtuse when dealing with Cho yet so sensitive and perceptive when dealing with others?  The main story line is involved and contrived... and ultimately not believeable.  So much hinges on key characters not communicating to each other, it's absurd.  And when the character count is so high, it is ultimately very difficult to deliver a satisfying treatment.  Last, the comeuppance for one truly sadistic character left me appalled.  This character might get payback in later installments... but with so much darkness and seeing Harry & Company put up with so much abuse, I for one was hoping for a little equity by the end of this one...

Harry has to attend a hearing about his imprper use of magic at the Ministry. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts Harry finds that a new defense against the Dark Arts teacher has been installed named Delores Umbridge who makes Snape look like a pussycat in comparison.

The power that Umbridge attains is truly frightening and serves a powerful reminder of how evil absolute power can be.

"4228",4,731947,FALSE,"As I had stated once before, it was not until just recently that I had paid all that much attention toward the Harry Potter book series. The films, on the other hand, I was quite intrigued by, The Prisoner of Azkaban being the most artistic and creatively captivating in the series thus far, but I had held neither the desire nor the curiosity to pursue reading through the novels. The Goblet of Fire of course changed all that and upon finishing the fourth book I quickly proceeded onto the fifth, expecting the same breeze read as I had with the last novel.Unfortunately for readers The Order of the Phoenix is not quite as exhilarating or fast-paced a ride as The Goblet of Fire was, this of course in large part due to the significant reduction in action throughout the novel until at least two-thirds of the way in. Needless to say this is a bit of a drawback for those who were drawn in with the last novel and this may turn some people off. Nonetheless, it remains a fascinating read right to the very end.The only vital piece of criticism I have concerning the contents of The Order of the Phoenix lies with the death of Harry's godfather, Sirius Black. For me at least his death near the end of the novel comes off as a bit anti-climatic. It happens so fast and without much detail directed toward it after words that it can only come off as being a bit of disappointment, especially considering the amount of hype Rowling herself put behind her hints prior to the novel's release that a major character would be killed off. Granted, there is only so much which can be accomplished on paper that can provide the proper effect of the scene which always be drawn out more emotionally speaking onscreen, which I fully expect from the future film adaptation. But as soon as Black dies, that's that it seems. The reader is not even given a reason as to what happened to Black when he fell through the archway behind the veil in the Department of Mysteries. There is no expectation, or at least there should not be one, that his character will reappear in the last two books in the series, with the exception of course for flashbacks, but an explanation as to what happened to him would be nice for new readers. There may be hope that this may be cleared up, if only in passing conversation, in The Half-Blood Prince.The Order of the Phoenix does take a stand on a specific political issue, in this instance government involvement in private education, but not to extent as the blatant criticism evident in The Goblet of Fire or even The Chamber of Secrets. The fifth novel uses the introduction of a new secondary character, Professor Umbridge, an official acting on behalf of the Ministry of Magic to spy on Albus Dumbledore and the help tighten its control over the activities of Hogwarts, to criticize government involvement in private education. Immediately there is this sense of animosity toward Professor Umbridge with her arrogant interruption of Dumbledore's opening speech and speaking down to the students as if they were nothing more then a bunch of mindless five year olds. This detestation increases as the reader proceeds through the novel and what happens to her in the end, though not as satisfactorily as one might hope, is quite amusing.The last third of novel, in spite of the shortfall which is the death of Sirius Black, makes the novel worth reading. Dumbledore's lengthy yet tantalizing explanation of the Lost Prophecy and its direct relation to young Harry is the most intriguing aspect of The Order of the Phoenix, something of which will undoubtedly play further in the last two books of the series. This should act as a main source of motivation for those who find themselves bored by the lack of action.",FALSE,2005,2226

But the way they are woven into the climax is pretty clever. And this time there actually IS a climax. Last time I felt like it was more of a poor excuse to tie up loose-ends and full of unconvincing exposition. Not so here I'm pleased to say, this is a better mystery with a better ending.Tho longer than Chamber of Secrets I find that this installment is quicker with more humor and sarcastic wit. I hope that JK Rowling keeps this up with the rest of the series as it is needed to balance out all the dark elements. I haven't read Goblet of Fire yet but I hope it's just as cool.

"4234",5,731191,FALSE,"On one level, the latest installment in the Harry Potter series delivers all the thrilling twists and turns, surprises, and action-packed drama that faithful readers (like me) have come to expect from this excellent serial adventure. However, as satisfying as the book is on this level -- and I'm not going to include any plot spoilers here! -- there is so much more going on that provides the richness and depth that make the Harry Potter books so much more than simple fantasy stories. More than any of the plot twists (which are great, as always), more than all of the hype and movies and merchandizing, it is these other elements, other layers of meaning, that explain the phenomenal success, not to mention the broad appeal, of the Harry Potter books. (and why a 33 year old lawyer such as myself would stay up until 3:30 am to finish the book two days after receiving it!)Like all good literature concerning children and young adults, The Order of the Phoenix has a sure grip on the emotional reality of its subjects that transcends the other-worldliness of its plot and genre. Harry is now 15, and Rowling expertly conjures (pun intended, I'm afraid) the rollercoaster of adolescence -- the feeling that you are the only one who has ever felt these confusing and powerful emotions. Of course, Rowling's hero is objectively, as well as subjectively, unique -- when Harry complains that no one understands how he feels or what it's like to be him (as every adolescent has felt and/or expressed at one point or another), it is obviously true: as we well know by now, Harry is the only one to have survived an attack by Lord Voldemort that was intended to kill its victim. Rather than diminish the reader's identification, however, these facts serve to validate those feelings so familiar to adolescent readers (and those who can recall that emotional landscape clearly), saying: ""it's true -- you are unique, and no one knows what it's like to be you."" Universal though adolescent experiences and emotions may be, we all had to experience it for ourselves, and no one else experienced exactly what we did -- this is the basis of our adult selves, each unique. The experiences, relationships and, critically, the choices we make in these years have an enormous impact on the development of our ""selves."" For Harry Potter, the backdrop for this transition is more extreme -- more fantastic as well -- than for mere muggles like ourselves, but Rowling imbues such an emotional reality that the magic is almost irrelevant.Beyond the plot and the exploration of adolescence, the Order of the Phoenix operates as an extended meditation on the distinction between moral and social (or even ""legal"") right and wrong. As Rowling illustrates, there does not always exist perfect congruence between these conceptions of ""good"" or ""right"" conduct. It isn't as simple as ""good"" and ""evil"" -- the most important conflicts appear among the different groups who are opposed to Voldemort, the embodiment of evil. Rowling draws subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, parallels to other conflicts between socio-legal and personal-moral conceptions of ""right"" that should be familiar to those acquainted with Martin Luther King's or Gandhi's philosophy of civil disobediance in the face of unjust laws. If you think I am overstating the case here, or making too much of ""kiddie books,"" you are wrong -- or simply in the dark. There is much to commend in this book on the level of profound moral exploration -- which makes the religious backlash against the Harry Potter books that much sadder (and ironic). I wish that the people who would burn this book could see past the magic wands for a moment and focus on the moral education that is the real core of these books (increasingly so, as the series progresses). Parents should all delight in the Harry Potter books -- not only for their wonderous power to make Nintendo seem boring in comparison (to reading!) -- but also for the opportunity they provide to discuss important issues of values and morals with their children.",FALSE,2003,1470

I just finished and overall, I'm feeling that sort of frustrating, sick feeling that I get when soemthing I've been looking forward to disappoints.Overall, I didn't think the prophesy was all that earth shattering...couldn't any of them have figured that out given all that's happened with Harry and Lord V?Another thing that annoyed me:  Most of the book's mishaps could have been avoided if Dumbledore or anyone for that matter had just said to Harry:  It's not a dream...he's trying to trick you.""Instead, everyone treats Harry like they can't tell him anything, even when 90% of the things going on are ABOUT him...and for a bunch of WIZARDS, that's a pretty stupid assumption.(Also, Dumbledore explained in the last bit of the book why he made RON a prefect, but what about Draco?  Why would Dumbledore do that?  The LAST thing that chap needed was more POWER!  Dumbledore HAD to know that Draco would only abuse the power and make Harry's life even more difficult!)It's things like that that make me more and more irritable with the ""grown ups"" of this series.For example, finally, at the end of Book five, the other wizards do something to hopefully ease the torture Harry faces every summer with the Dursley's.  Um, and why hasn't anyone done this BEFORE?  I would be angry too (if I were Harry) at having to go home to be starved and locked in and abused...and the people who's lives I'd helped save all this time didn't lift a finger to help me.  No explanation of why he HAD to go home, just go on, it'll be okay, it's only a few weeks of torture and then you're back at Hogwarts where we'll keep you in the dark for most of the book until you need the truth to save our lives.  *huh?*I saw that JKRowling was trying to show us Harry's getting a smidge conceited in the early part of the book, but, to me, it didn't really work, nor did it really follow thru the last half of the book.  That whole thing sort of fell by and they focused on the dreams and stuff.I mean, all the end stuff could have been avoided if just one of the so called grown ups or Order of the Phoenix people had bothered communicating with Harry.And, why in the world didn't Harry look for that package from Sirius like oh, when he DESPERATELY needed to talk to Sirus?  *stupid*  I mean, that was seriously dumb on Harry's part and when he does finally remember it in the end, he doesn't think about how useful that would have been earlier..how he could have avoided the end death scene completely if he'd only remembered that package.All in all, I came away from this wishing for more meat...SOMETHING...I had pretty much deduced the ""prophecy"" all on my own, from everything else that's happened in the books.  I am as depressed as Harry right now. LOL  I found the whole ""cleaning of Gimmbauld..number 12"" section of the book to be REALLY slow and not really useful in adding anything.I miss Harry from books one and two...He was either irritable, mean, or moping in this one.  Then again, I would be irritated too if everyone kept giving me orders, expecting me to just do it and never told me anything that might make it all ""make sense"" and Dumbledope's LONG explanation at the end...I thought it was building up to something HUGE...and I was like ""Yeah, so?

"4236",5,731189,FALSE,"In less than twenty eight hours (including naps and food breaks) I finished Joanne Rowling's latest addition to the ongoing saga of Harry Potter. I picked up my copy and quickly became immersed once again in the magical world of witches and wizards.As found in the previous book (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) Voldemort has indeed returned to his body. Upon returning to Hogwarts after escaping Voldemort, Harry managed to convince Dumbledore that the Dark Lord had risen again. Dumbledore (being Dumbledore) quickly tries to spread the word but Fudge, Minister of Magic, is unwilling to accept that Voldemort has returned.Now, in book 5, Harry is back with Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Harry is very burnt up because he can't seem to find out any news about Voldemort. The Muggle news isn't picking up on it and his connections in the wizarding world can't say hardly anything in letters in case the letters are intercepted.The first point I'll make is that Harry is very on edge in this book. He gets rather upset at Ron and Hermione because they can't tell him all that he wants to know.The thing, however, that had me glued to this book was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Dolores Umbridge is possibly the foulest women to set foot in Hogwarts. I was actually cursing out loud as I read because what she does in book 5 is so evil. A sample of her sick behavior is making Harry do lines in detention. However, when Harry uses the special quill provided, the skin on his right hand is branded with what he writes. Well, not branded; the words are cut into his hand and the blood from the wound makes up the words on the parchment.This is only the beginning of Professor Umbridges horrors that she unleashes upon Harry and, in fact, the whole school.To not give anything away, I'll merely give some brief occurences of importance in the new novel. Someone close to Harry is killed. Hagrid has a surprise in the Forbidden Forest. Harry starts a rebellion. Harry goes to two large establishments in the magical world. Harry and Cho's relationship takes several twisting turns. Harry learns from Dumbledore why Voldemort wants to kill him and why he must return to number 4 Privet Drive. Fred and George outdo themselves spectacularly in this book as well.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was fascinating and shows more of the magical world than just Hogwarts and the village. The story spreads out and makes a much more interesting read. The plot thickens and turns as readers begin to comprehend what Hary and, indeed, the whole magical world is up against. The previous books have only given quick snaps of the older wizards reliving what it was like during Voldemort's rise to power or what the students at Hogwarts have heard from their parents. Now with Voldemort back and his Death Eaters spreading rapidly, one can only imagine what horrors, twists, and turns await in the upcoming two books that will end the saga of Harry Potter.",FALSE,2003,1468
"4237",5,731559,FALSE,"I'm one of the many ""grown-ups"" hooked on Harry. I've read all the books and loved them all. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is no exception.

In fact, my niece insisted on being at the book store the very moment it went on sale, midnight.It was a quick read and now I'm waiting anxiously for the next installment. I have the movies to keep me going but I need to know what happens.Most of my friends rely on the HP movies to tell them this fantastic story. To me that's sad. They are missing so much that the novel brings that cannot be in the movies. It's too difficult to compress so much detail into just the 2 hours or so that we are given in the theater.""The Order of the Phoenix"" as far as the individual book goes, apart from the series, was very exciting and riveting. We learn why Harry must stay with his terrible aunt and uncle. We also learn much more of Harry's past and about his link with the evil Voldemort.Harry's nemesis is getting trickier and more evil with every book. With each new book comes another more sinister attempt by Voldemort to take over with his evil plans. While Harry has proven to be a formidable opponent, it seems apparent that Voldemort will challenge Harry to the very end. The end of what?

"4238",4,731193,FALSE,"I, like so many millions of others, was suffering the effects of extreme anticipation up until June 21st of 2003. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix took a while to read. Quite a while, in fact. But I grew more excited with every page. True, Harry was a lot less innocent than in the previous installments of the series, but this served to add a considerable amount of depth to the book.  After finally having finished, I can honestly say that I'm a lot more confused than I thought I would end up. At many points throughout the story, I found myself bouncing with glee, free of all doubt that this was the best Harry Potter yet. But after reading the climax of the novel, I found myself a good deal less jubilant. The book itself, I don't feel, was too long in its entirety. At certain places however, most notably the very end, it did seem to drag. I found that some of the ""unexpected surprises"" that J.K. Rowling so often has in store for us, were not so ""unexpected"" after all.  The dialogue was very well written, and I liked the separations between chapters, but some questions were left unanswered, and indeed, some specific things just didn't seem to make much sense. It was not as gratifying as the other books in the series. By this, I mean that the questions J.K. often leaves us with throughout the book, were not as well answered at the end. Perhaps this is just what the author wanted; maybe we were supposed to figure those things out by ourselves. Maybe they'll be answered in the sixth book. Maybe I just missed something. I don't know.  If this all just sounds like babbling, I'll give you an example: Professor Umbridge (great character!) enjoyed a triumphant capture of Harry, Hermione, and Ron toward the end of the book. Of course, someone needed to think of a way out of this, and Hermione seemed as if she had quite a plan. What she did end up doing, however, was a bit too predictable, and not as much of a clever surprise as J.K. usually delivers. As another case in point, when the kids are in the department of mysteries, they seem to spend a great deal of time dawdling around, when they should in fact be focusing on the mission at hand. And finally, I just have to say that I think it's very odd that no muggles seemed to have noticed Harry and his gang arriving at the entrance to the Ministry of Magic, considering their less-than-average mode of travel.  By no means allow my review to deter you from reading this (as I'm sure it won't). It was a truly magnificent book. Ms. Rowling did as great a job as ever, probably better than usual in fact, of building up the tension for the final release at the end. It's just that the ""final release"" didn't quite seem up to standard.",FALSE,2003,1472
"4239",5,731188,FALSE,"I have to say, I've read a few of the less than stellar reviews of this book and it rather saddens me.  While it's truly fantastic that Rowling's readers not simply love a book on the basis of its four predecessors, that they are constantly raising standards, I think it is an absolute atrocity that those self same readers do not give Ms. Rowling the benefit of the doubt that every word on the page is intentional.  To think otherwise does a severe injustice to the author.  It also upsets me that most of the negative reviews I've read stem from the reader measuring the book by his or her own set of standards and not by the standards which it sets up for itself.  Does Rowling succeed in doing what she herself intended with the book?  My take on this is yes, absolutely.We've all heard by now that the fifth installment of the Harry Potter series is a shade darker and a hundred pages longer.  This, (although it is to some) should come as no surprise.  That progression was set up with the very first sequel.  What is surprising, however is that what many have said is the book's weakest point is actually what I found to be most rewarding: Harry has in the course of one summer become highly irrational, incredibly emotional and moodier than Mad Eye.  In short, he has become so unreasonable it is incredibly frustrating to read.  But to paraphrase a certain bearded wizard, too often the older and experienced make the fatal mistake of forgetting what youth is.If forgetfulness is a measure of age then, Rowling couldn't be younger.  In addition to the very real pressures of standardized testing at schools, Harry finds himself a bundle of emotional contradictions and always at odds with what he's feeling and what he's thinking; pulled in two different directions at all times.  Rowling has very intelligently used this juncture of her character's emotional growth as a tool to both illustrate and reveal another plot point in the saga.  His teen-aged angst threatening to tear him apart from within parallels a very measurable external danger (Lord Voldemort) who also threatens the very same thing.  This, while in and of itself is just smart writing, speaks to another point of contention among the fans: Harry's growth.For reasons unbeknownst to me,  some readers have taken issue with the fact that the books get progressively less ""children's story-esque.""  Apparently, their own children simply do not grow.  Rowling's choice to allow her characters (and subsequently her fictions) to grow with the readers that originally put her on the map is as daring as it is well informed and should no more be criticized then discounted.  Make no mistake, this was a choice.  And a good one at that.  The universe she invites us to look in on expands without contradicting itself.  The rules don't change, they just get more specific.  No easy task.  Decades from now, when the series is finished, it will not simply be something older parents suggest to newer ones, whose children are just starting to get excited about literature.  It will not be a ""The Shoes"" series, it will not be a ""Sweet Valley High/Hardy Boys"" or even a ""Stories of Prydain.""  It will be among the must-reads of sci-fi and fantasy lovers everywhere, canonized with the likes of  J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.  Coincidence?  I think not.These same readers take issue with the thematic implications of government and education.  Now, comparing it to the standards usually set when measuring the value of a children's story, I can understand why that might be cause for apprehension in some parents.  Choosing what messages you want  your children to be initially introduced to is of the highest importance.  Admittedly, children aren't simply born with the ability to gather information and on the basis of rational thought, choose a conclusion.  It seems to me though, that that is exactly why these issues are not raised until book five.  As singular as the story and its events are, it is still seven separate books each with their own individual identity, each addressing its own individual themes.  Is it then, all that surprising that life parallel fiction?  That like the character's Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons, we the readers are now finally learning to identify and defend ourselves against a grown-up life replete with corruption and misguided, bureaucratic good intentions?  There are, after all, such things in the world.  While themes of corruption in government are definitely present, what is equally present are the themes of truth and honesty and their implicit virtues, as represented by the Order of the Phoenix.  Rowling sets up a clear drama of two opposing forces and like all good writers, uses their inherent conflict to tell a very satisfying fiction while teaching an equally probing lesson that makes the reader question much more than just why such-and-such a character had to be killed off.Why, all of a sudden, it is distasteful for some to have an inkling of drama in their stories, however, might just forever be a mystery.",FALSE,2003,1467

He's getting older, he's taken on tremendous tasks and yet the adults around him still want to treat him as a child.  It's no wonder that he spent a good portion of this book being angry and frustrated.  I thought the book did a good job of showing how kids mature, given their very different circumstances.  Ron and Hermione have loving and supportive families and only have stressful situations at school.  Harry's life is stress 24-7-365 lately.  The only criticism I have for this book and it's not really criticism is that it is mostly filler.  Books 1-4 were pretty much stand alone books in the sence that there is a beginning middle and end contained therein with the Voldemort return plot intermixed.

This, I think is Rowling's true gift: we watch Harry twisting through the agonies of his teens, compounded by the overwhelming pressures of his battle with Voldemort and his horrible guilt over the events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament in ""Goblet of Fire"". This is a REAL teenager--getting angry, getting his heart cut to ribbons, yelling and aggravating even the people who love him best.

I think it's been too long since Ms. Rowling was 15, and she's never had the displeasure of being a boy.  These two facts seem evident that when she tries to pain Harry as having rebelious streaks, he merely comes across as being annoying, and angry for no real reason.  Also, the scenes with Cho seemed somewhat contrived, and too few for the book, in my opinion.  Aside from this,  I also took issue with two other parts of the book:  the centaur scene near the end & the death of the major charector.  Both were too short, and both deserved more space in a book already 870 pages.  After taunting every student at Hogwarts and nearly destroying the school, Dolores got off far too easy in the end.  Also, when ""padfoot"" falls through the arch, it seems mystifying to believe he's really gone.  Everyone else hit with similar curses merely got treated and moved on.  ""Padfoot"" however died.  It didn't make sense, nor did I feel the scene was well written.  In addition to that, when Neville can't speak correctly, he can't cast a spell, and yet when Haromie casts a spell to silence a Death Eater, she's struck back with a curse that nearly kills her.  Since when can mute wizards cast spells?  And if so, why couldn't Neville, just cause he was pronouncing things just a bit off..?

If I went thru what he did, plus having to put up with the Dursleys, I think I'd be in a bad mood too. It makes his character seem less perfect and more human.It's also interesting to see Harry as a teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Might be a sign of what's to come for him.Also liked that Harry was able to see his father thru Snape's memories. I think it mirrors that moment we all have in life when we discover that our parents are real people after all, ones who make real mistakes just like the rest of us.The experiences that Harry has trying to understand girls resonates, I think, with all of us, young or old. The comment that girls should write a book about how they think and act so that boys can understand them is very funny. And a little bit true. (Maybe Rowling should think about writing such a book as a side project.)From a technical/writing standpoint, Rowling's great dialog and short paragraphs make for a quick reading pace. That being said, ""Phoenix"" is still a very long book (over 800 pages). I think she could've tightened up the story and cut about 200 pages.With the discovery of the ""kill-or-be-killed"" prophecy about Harry and Voldemort, the story definitely has a more adult tone to it now.

After all, we are talking about denial, corrupt politics, war, and (sadly) death.  Harry is moody and often angry throughout the book.  And why shouldn't he be?  He had just seen a classmate die before his eyes, he had been left to worry during the summer with no sign of what he knew would be the most terrible event in over a decade, Umbridge and the Ministry have made his fifth year one pain after another, and he was not being taken seriously by the Ministry or most other wizards outside of the Order.  I found it refreshing that Rowling captured what I think are typical and reasonable emotions of an adolescent in Harry's position.  Harry is a realistic hero.  He is mature for his age, but he still makes mistakes and is highly emotional.  (Surprise, he's 15!)  He is someone who we can relate to, rather than someone whose reactions are predictible and unattainable.But don't let the darkness get you down.  There are many, many warm and funny moments to balance it off.  Harry's friendships with Ron and Hermione become even closer and deeper, which I suspect will be invaluable to Harry in the future; the Weasley twins are funnier than ever (there were many moments when I laughed out loud); and just as Rowling answered many mysteries, she planted even more to keep us on our toes.  In this book we are introduced to new characters and learn more about the ones we have already grown to love (and despise).  And some of the interactions between the characters are absolutely hilarious (see, e.g., Prof. McGonigal and Umbridge).Overall, the book is brilliant.  Despite its length, I could not put the book down.  It was funny, moving, sad, fast-paced, and exciting.  Now I can't stop wondering about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Now that no one can deny Voldemort's return, what is in store for Harry and his friends, Hogwarts, and the entire wizarding world?",FALSE,2004,1866

The book centers around Harry and his much-increased troubles over the summer and especially back at Hogwart's.

His cohorts all return, each with their own new challenges that add to their time being drawn away from being able to help Harry, but somehow finding a way to prepare together for their dreaded exams that will dtermine their magical careers ahead.For children, this is too dark a dark book to be introduced to Harry effectively, but no problem if they have read the previous books.

This one is 226 pages longer than Book #2, The Chamber of Secrets.)In this book, Harry becomes a teenager. He spends his thirteenth birthday, as usual, with his miserable relatives, The Dursleys. However, after feeling sorry for himself all day, he gets a phone call from Ron...that's a trip, and letters from Hermoine and Hagrid. He's feeling better now. However, a visit by Aunt Marge, Uncle Vernon's sister, the next day is a disaster. You'll have to read Chapter Two to appreciate what happens to Aunt Marge.We move on to Hogwarts School where there is real danger for Harry this year. It seems a vicious criminal, Sirius Black, has escaped Azkaban Prison, a most dreadful place for only the most vicious of criminals, kept in line by the terrifying Dementors who suck the breath from their victims. It seems Black is looking for Harry. Everyone is terrified, and Harry and friends are faced with many harrowing moments. Near the end of the book, Harry has a close encounter with a Dementor and commits an act that will cause him considerable grief later. (Exactly what is a Dementor? A brief description from p. 384: ""Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth...a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle."")This book has some truly terrifying passages that are extremely well crafted.

"4270",4,731930,FALSE,"Okay...let me admit. I am in my middle 20's and I am a huge fan of Harry Potter. It took me a while to warm up to the books and the movies, but now I can't get enough of Potter and his friends.I recently finished The Order of the Phoenix and I have to say....it took me a good 2 weeks to read it. I am usually a fast reader but this book felt like a chore when I opened it up to read. There were many parts in the book that just dragged on. And personally, when I read a book it is hard for me to continue reading if I lose my interest. But don't get me wrong....there were some things in this book that made me laugh and cry(Im not going to spoil it for anyone out there that doesn't know). I also enjoyed the fact that the situations in the book are a little more darker than the previous ones.The 5th book of the series is about Harry and his friends once again facing 'He who shall not be named'. It takes place after Harry won the competition in 'Goblet of Fire'. He was the only one that saw Voldemort and he knew that he would return. Now Harry faces his 5th year at Hogwarts and there are many kids who think that he is a liar and just stirring things up about the reapperance of Voldemort. Obviously Harry has a lot of people that believe that Voldemort is going to rise soon and they want to be there to take him down. This is how the Order of Phoenix comes about.....it is a group of experienced wizards that faced Voldemort before(with Harrys parents).I thought that The Order of the Phoenix was a good book overall. But it was quite a struggle for me to read a large amount at one time. It wasn't until a little bit past the middle of the book that I actually got into it and wanted to know what was going to happen next. I suggest that everyone interested in Harry Potter should of course read this book(I mean you do want to know the full story don't you). In the end I decided that the book was well worth my time just because of what Harry finds out from Dumbledore.

"4275",4,732284,FALSE,"Harry Potter hits his teens (and Hermione hits Malfoy) in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the third book in J.K. Rowling's fantasy series. There are more classes, more teachers, more locations, more spells and more intrigue than before.Harry has just turned thirteen, and its just about time for him to go to Hogwarts. After an accidental bit of magic at his aunt and uncle's, Harry runs away from home. Harry's not the only one to be on the run this year. Mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped the infamous wizard prison of Azkaban, a man so dangerous even the non-wizard community has been put on alert.  Word is, he's planning on coming to Hogwarts, so the school's security is increased. The creepy Dementors now guard its gates, and Harry feels uneasy. What's all this got to do with a phantom hound he keeps seeing? Why does Ron's rat Scabbers look so ill? Why does Hermione suddenly have no time for them, but all the time for her multiple elective classes? And just who exactly is their mysterious new Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin?The Hogwarts kids are starting to grow up, and you can see little signs of this here and there. Though its hardly a major part of the book, you can tell that Harry is starting to notice girls. It's also mentioned that he's a little taller. An odd thing I noticed is that the magic sweets and candies are back. They are first mentioned in ""Sorcerer's Stone"", but are completely absent in ""Chamber of Secrets"". I assumed it was because they were growing up, but Rowling must have just forgot about the sweets in the second book. There's also a lot of chocolate here. I wonder what will be on the menu in ""Goblet of Fire""? Quidditch (the sport of wizards) is again a fairly big part of Harry's life. Though I wasn't really into this side of the plot earlier in the series, I'm starting to warm to it. I might even try to get me hands on that Quidditch video game, just to see how it would work in a practical way.There are a few twists and turns in the plot, but after reading a couple of Harry Potter books I can kind of guess where Rowling's head is at, and was able to guess a couple of the twists before they happened. (Hermione's secret, for instance). Still, there were some that were total surprises to me.Harry Potter has been criticized by a few certain groups as being pro real life witchcraft. I've found this to be a very odd accusation, being a fantasy story, but I've still kept my eye out to see if such a theory could hold weight. One of the big themes of this book is how inaccurate and silly the whole new age/psychic scene is (by way of Harry's dodgy Divination classes). I'd say that was quite a positive theme to put out there, and a very ANTI-real life witchcraft theme at that. On the other hand, one of Harry's homework assignments sees him writing on witch burnings of history, a set of real historical events which Rowling makes a comment about through the text (""pointless""). It's a dangerous minefield of a subject to just make a throwaway comment like that about. Even in me mentioning it, I'm trying to choose me words carefully so I'm not misunderstood, let alone make a careless throwaway comment about like Rowling does.  It's only a minor thing, but I just think she oversimplifies the issue, and tangles up a real life event in her fantasy unneccessarily.Still, it is a very entertaining book. I've been reading the series through, but I'll probably take a break now before heading into the brick-sized ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"". What will happen next?

When she refuses to allow the students to practice defense against the dark arts magic in or out of the classroom, Harry and his friends organize an illegal group they name Dumbledore's army. Secretly, they practice the magic needed to defend against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Good thing, too, as they will need these magical skills sooner than they would like.While this was not my favorite entry in the Harry Potter series, it was still quite entertaining the second time around in audio format. I didn't like the way the Sirius character developed in this book. I thought Harry could have used a more mature role model. Dumbledore was absent throughout most of this book while Hogwarts fell deeper and deeper under the control of someone he greatly disliked. Although supposedly he was busy with the Order of the Phoenix, I thought that this was out of character for the school's headmaster. The whole story could have been a bit tighter.

I cannot explicitly describe the book without giving away some secrets, so I will just say this: this novel is much darker and more violent than it's predeccesors so parents of extremely young children be warned. The stakes are higher this time around, and of course, Harry's life is in serious danger (when isn't it?). A fantastic book that will not dissapoint hardcore fans and should get Rowling some new ones.P.S. - It really helps to read Goblet of Fire right before Order of the Phoenix, because there are many small details and plot points from book 4 that (for me at least) were hard to remember.",FALSE,2003,1468

This is all handled excellently by Rowling, and although the book is very long, it in fact doesn't seem to be.  The plotting is swift and as interesting as ever, as readers learn more about Harry's world, and the divisions among its leaders. For younger kids I would say the book does have some frightening stuff in it, which makes sense given that Voldemort has now returned and turmoil is spreading Harry's world.  Also, there is, as Rowling said in an interview, the dath of a major player, and I must admit I was personally surprised and sad about this person's death, though it is fully justified in the plot.  It's just that, unlike Cedric Diggory from _Goblet_, this is someone much more central who was introduced in earlier books and whom Harry cares a great deal about.

As I said, this part makes sense - the good guys are fighting a war at this point, after all - but a seven or eight year old, or the parent of one, might want to know what's coming to prepare a younger child for this.Again, an excellent addition to the series!

Now they're stationed at the school's entrances to make sure Black is caught if he tries to get in, and the students are pretty much confined to the school. One pleasant surprise is the appointment of ""teddy bear biker"" Hagrid. Last year he was finally cleared of the charges that got him tossed out when he was a student himself, and over the summer the retirement of one professor has resulted in his getting that teaching vacancy. Also back is Harry's peer nemesis Draco Malfoy, one of those kids whose need to insult people seems as essential as the air he breathes. It may be tempting to hope author Rowling will ""write him out"", the sooner the better, but he does provide a balance to the stories. A sort of peer counterpart to Harry's hateful Uncle Vernon at home. No matter what the bunch who nowadays approach the issue of school bullying as if it can be cured completely might say, not to mention political correctness zealots, there will always be hateful, hurtful people in the real world. It's been pointed out in earlier stories that Malfoy's behavior is traceable to his upbringing by a bigoted father, but there are people like him everywhere. There will always be people who seem born with a sneer on their faces. The fact that Rowling includes real world problems in these books is part of what gives them the kind of credibilty that elevates them above fairy tale level. It will always be best to avoid promising children in their formative years ""a rose garden"", as the old song goes.

Black has recently escaped from the prison of Azkaban, where the guards heard him muttering ""he's at Hogwarts"".

It's a teenager thing!  I know I was angry with my parents most of the time over nothing.....I was just angry to be angry.For those that are against it because it promotes witchcraft.  Get over it....it's a book...it's meant to entertain.  It is not real and even my 4 year old knows that it is not real.  He loves Harry Potter.

Mostly the book doesn't do anything, but setting the scene for the later volumes. The tone of the book is darker then before and the enemies faced by characters are more internal then external here. Thus there is not much actual plot in the way of previous novels. Not that it's a dull reading. J.K. Rowling created an engaging cast of characters, which can keep you reading even without enough plot. While most characters remain true to themselves, Harry in the novel is changed. He is always nearly boiling with anger directed at anyone close to him. Yes, this is obvious his coming of age, but why does it have to happen every few pages, and why doesn't it happen to Ron? Harry's constant anger was a bit annoying.On the other hand, the way Harry's relations with Cho are handled is exceptionally good. I think it's important for young readers to know that such things can happen. There are also some interesting points raised about Harry's father, which, hopefully will be developed in the remaining novels.I still love this series dearly, but hopefully the remaining volumes will have more plot. Also, I really hope, that it would take the author less then 3 years to write the next one.",FALSE,2003,1526

The mixture of teenaged hormones and the wicked, behind the scenes machinations of the supporters of Voldemort will keep readers guessing at what happens next through the 800+ pages of this story. And it takes EVERY page to do justice to the telling.As we have come to expect from J.K.Rowling, Harry's world is chock full of wonderful detail and boundless imagination. New wonders, challenges and dangers spill from the pages in such profusion that as soon as the last page was turned, I was tempted to start reading it all over again.Only a 'real Mum' could have done such a masterful job of capturing the mixture of teen-angst and growing pains of the young witches and wizards.But this is only a small component of the whole. With this installment, we are getting much closer to knowing the true nature of the evil that will, no doubt dominate the final two books. Some of the characters we thought we knew well, became much changed in this book.In the true Rowling tradition, there are a couple of characters that you will love to hate! There are twists and turns in the plot that will have you tied in knots and reading well after your regular bedtime. And I warn you, one reading won't be enough!Now, the wait begins for number six!

It seems Harry hasn't completely recovered from the trauma he experienced at the end of last year. He is very short with his friends, Ron and Hermione, and his anger is always ready to explode at anyone who crosses him. To top it off, few people believe his story of what happened to Cedric.If anything, his present school situation is just making him feel worse. He is loaded with work from all classes to prepare him for his O.W.L. (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) exams. Dumbledore seems to have forgotten all about him and worst of all, a sadistic and evil Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is tearing down the school from the inside.Yet Harry, through all this, still finds the strength to stand up to the injustice he sees all around him. He finds friends he didn't know he had (and they're not just in Gryffindor) who not only believe him, they want to learn from him. Come the threat of expulsion or imprisonment, he still stands.This kind of courage is something we all could use during difficult times in our life. This applies not only to children, but to adults as well. In these times of war, economic hardship and fear, we all could use the strength to stand up for what is right and the courage to find new ways of thriving. J.K. Rowling is truly and excellent writer and she has epitomized Harry in this courage. I recommend this book to anyone, young or old, who wishes to find strength you never knew about.",FALSE,2003,1469

Furthermore, I could not help but consider Harry a close friend by the end of the book as I imagined what future adventures he will have in number 4.I was a little wary of book 3, thinking it would falter without Voldemort being the main antagonist.  However the conflict rolled out nicely towards the end and made the last one hundred or so pages move rapidly.  I had no desire to stop digesting the workThings are looking up for Harry in his 3rd year.  He finally seems to have hopes for the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin.  He is given the best broom out there by someone mysterious.  Hagrid is teaching a class.  Everything seems perfect.  But not so, Sirius Black has escaped and is hunting Harry.  Hogwarts is surrounded by Dementors to keep him out, but Harry's experience with them is one he would rather forget.  Hagrid's teaching position is even threatened because his Hippogriff, Buckbeak is scheduled for execution for hurting Draco Malfoy.

Having finished this book in four days, I found myself often getting upset at the irresponsible, self-centered attitude Harry has developed (anyone who dares to yell at Dumbledore deserves to get the Crucio curse). Sure, it was to show a troubled adolescence all the more twisted by having to fight evil dudes at every turn. Still, a lot of times I wished someone would just give Harry the beating he never got. At the same time, the familiar wit and jokes we've gotten used to in the series is present, so faithfuls will find it easy to get into. Lots of teasers, something always happening... but we have this very disturbed version of Harry. Hopefully he grows up in the next two books and avoids becoming like his father.One thing that this book manages to avoid is the repetitious introduction of the main characters, which the previous books dedicated a significant amount to.

I love how the main characters are growing.  Harry, Ron and Hermoine all are developing attitudes.  Then again, whether you're Wizard or Muggle, when you're 13, you have an attitude.  Ron refuses to take any more crud from Malfoy, while Hermione has become a 120% workaholic.  The encounters the three friends have also endangers their friendship, as accusations and arguments begin to fly.  Professor Snape has become just plain nasty.  The introduction of Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was a good touch.  Looks unassuming, but has a first rate mind and is a hit with the students.  But is there more to him?  Oh yeah, and Rowling puts together another awesome Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin.  Much more rough and tumble than in the previous two novels.

After reading the other reviews,I have to wonder if some of the adults have forgotten what it is like to be a teenager. Harry is definitely not perfect in this book. He is jealous of his friends for being chosen prefects (who would not if they were his age with his background). He does have a lot of conflict (some of it due to his connection with Voldemort). I thought that J.K. Rowling did a great job of having the teenage inner conflict. My only complaint is that Harry is so disrespectful to Professor Snape. Harry is completely unforgiving with Snape, even though Snape has worked to help him in the past. Even Dumbledore has told Harry Snape is trustworthy. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It is about a teenage protagonist. Like most teens, Harry thinks he is invincible. I can't wait to read Half Blood Prince.",FALSE,2005,2230

He's brave, caring, courageous.... but he always ends up being involved in some kind of trouble.  This year is no different.  A prisoner known as Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban.  And it is said that he is after Potter, for the dementors,  (vicious hooded prison guards capable of terrible and horrible things), heard Sirius saying ""He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts,"" in his sleep.  With Black loose, Harry is not safe and is about to find out just how much more of his past has been left in the dark.  Secrets will be revealed, revelations will show themselves, and Harry's life will never be the same again.As I have said before, I am now a fan of the Harry Potter series.  I think they are very well written books with great creativeness and imagination that can appeal to both children and adults.  ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" proves to be even better than the first two books.  In fact, I have to say that so far this is my favorite one.  (I have read all four of them.)  It's more darker and intended for older readers.  (That doesn't mean little kids won't enjoy it as well.  I just like the fact how each book gets more and more intended for older readers.)J.K. Rowling is a fabulous writer.  She takes on the genera of fantasy head on, and just when you think she cannot outdo herself any further, she surprises you once again.  The books may be getting longer, but once you start reading them you don't want to stop until the very end.  You say to yourself you'll only read one more chapter, and it turns to be ten chapters instead.  That is the sign of a great writer.  If you don't want to put the book down for a second, then the author has done his or her job.  Rowling does more than get the job done, she works overtime and goes to great lengths to give her readers satisfaction.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is by far my favorite Potter book.  There was nothing boring or wordy about it.  It was just right, and then some.  It's going to be hard to top this one, but knowing Rowling, she'll probably surprise me once again.  I have finished the fourth one, and it was ALMOST as good as this one, but I still think the third book's the best.  This is a great read for all ages.  I was very surprised and amazed.

And what about the threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?Never fear, all your answers will be found after reading the book -- and then some! New allegiances, disappearances, gadgets and gizmos abound, but probably the most enjoyable aspect is how Harry deals with life and adolescence.He stands up to his cousin, his friend and makes rash decisions when authority figures rain on his parade. We've all been there and done that. In fact, many still do. And that's a big reason why adults have embraced the previous four novels, and have this one too (well, so far . . . ). There's a little bit of Harry in everyone. No matter how false the bravado or how real the fear, there's a little wizard inside everyone who just wants to jump on their Nimbus and go play some Quidditch.If I could, I'd give this book 10 stars. I started reading it Saturday, and except for my job, I scarcely put it down. J.K. Rowling certainly has lost none of her touch or love for the characters. I can't wait for the next installment.

But unfortunately, Harry Potter is perfection to the fourteenth degree--it really could be considered something that is setting new criteria for children's literature.The third sojourn in the world of Hogwarts turns out to be the best so far.  Harry, Ron and Hermione once again frolic through Rowling's meticulously fine-tuned world with the usual aplomb, except that everything that has ever been brought up in the prior novels receives a facelift this time around--nothing is quite what you may have thought it to be.  While there is no immediate sense of danger felt save for in a few key scenes, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" somehow manages to convey a stronger sense of adventure than the last books, and the few little morsels of actual danger that are given every several chapters prove strong enough incentives to continue the novel into the wee hours of the night.The book also introduces two new characters--Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher, and Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor.  And if I may say, every scene in which these two characters are in outshines anything that you may have read in this series up to this point.And, well, Sirius Black--what an ingenious way to add dimension to Harry's character.See? All you can do when you find perfection is heap praise upon it, and it's leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.  At the expense of sounding even more obsequious, I'll say the following: Read this and move on to the fourth book--quickly.  And hope that the fifth installment comes out soon.",FALSE,2001,814

I am an adult with less time to read than I used to have, so two weeks is a really fast read for me. I did not get tired at all in witnessing Harry's anger, a sustained, startling difference from the earlier books. That J.K Rowling has explained her reasons for using that trait, that Harry is reacting to his plight as a hormonally ravaged teenager, makes sense. If you want to sympathize with him as a human. Other new features are the way Mrs. Rowling keeps us guessing at the identity of the next person to die. I won't give any details as to how she does that, except that these tactics are rendered cleverly. I am amazed by certain reactions of the Dursleys in this book. And I like the love story here, but I fear Mrs. Rowling may moderate this due to revelations made in Order of the Phoenix. Harry's spiritual outlook will change forever. This is my second favorite of all the Harry Potter books after The Prisoner of Azkaban.

It appears as though Rowling is running out of steam ( and good storylines).  This novel takes us more on a journey through a troubled adolescent mind than anything else.  We see Harry go from  being a pleasant, resourceful, and loveable young boy to being a resentful, brooding teenager. I'm not sure I care for this change.  As a matter of fact, many of the major characters lose a great deal of their luster and likeability.  We see the great Dumbledore in a less than positive light, even questioning his usually impeccable judgment.  Sirius becomes a moody, pouty housemate, no longer the likeable, eccentric godfather figure.

Some say teenage angst, but also he does have a lot more to deal with, I mean considering Voldemort's return and the standardized tests that helps decide a large part of his future.  In addition, with so many more pages, Harry's personality is delved into deeper and deeper, especially in his relationships with his friends, his godfather Sirius, and his crush, Cho.

In the first forty pages, Harry gets attacked by some nasty creatures, expelled from then reinstated into school and kicked out then allowed back into his home. Wow! It may be 870 pages long, but it reads like lightning.We get to see Harry and his friends maturing into adults, and our hero has to deal with emotional and physical hurdles that make obstacles in the previous books seem like a walk in the park.I'm really impressed with the way adults were handled in this book. In the first four parts most adults were cut-outs. But this time around, except for Cornelius Fudge and Vold--er, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, all the characters show multiple dimensions. Snape is a bit justified in his loathing of Harry. James Potter was an arrogant punk. Sirius is a bit too eager to get into some action. Mrs. Weasley isn't just a Pollyanna. Even Dumbledore admits to having some failings.Also, while this book doesn't have the mystery of ""who's the bad guy?"" proffered in the previous installments, Prof. Umbridge is presented as a particularly cringeworthy villain, a true McCarthyite. Through Umbridge's actions and results, J.K. slips in (at least I took it this way) some timely political commentary on the results of an overly oppressive government organization.A fantastic page turner with a spectacular ending.

And speaking of Harry, in this book he's extremely moody and gets mad at everyone (Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, Cho, ect.) and I felt really annoyed at how pompous he's becoming.

Every event included is just dragged on too long, and truth be told, I sort of didn't like Harry much.

After a long wait, we finally found ourselves in the presence of the boy wizard again.  And some of us were disappointed...I know I'm not going to be popular for saying so, but I had a lot of problems with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  For the first two weeks I had it, I barely touched it; I would try to read it, but the story just didn't seem to be going anywhere.  I almost decided to give up on it.  But I kept going, hoping the story would take off and grab my imagination.For a book that took so long to write, I would have expected a lot more editing.  Take out a little bit of unnecessary dialogue here (can you say ""er...?""), a little bit of irrelevant description there, and the book probably could have been trimmed to a more manageable size (reading this thing in bed is hard on the fingers... 700+ pages in hardcover make for a heavy book!).  I was also appalled at the lack of proper grammar.  Everyone in this book talks in run-on sentences!  I don't remember noticing this in the previous four books, but then, this book didn't have a really interesting storyline to distract me.Book 5 also doesn't stand on its own.  You really have to have read the previous four books to make sense of all the references (and since I hadn't re-read any of the other books in preparation for this one, I couldn't properly remember half of the things that were mentioned... three years is a long time to have to remember all those little details).  There are still so many unanswered questions.  After 766 pages, I feel sort of empty and cheated.  Harry's lost someone else in his life, for seemingly little reason other than to make him more miserable.  There had better be some really good explanations in Books 6 and 7!Finally, I realize this is first and foremost a series of books, not movies.  But, as it looks probable that all of these books will be turned into movies at some point, I am rather disturbed.  Book Four was depressing enough; how that could be made into a movie for kids, I'm not sure.  Book Five would have people leaving the theatres in tears of frustration and grief!  After all, who wants to spend $... to see a depressing cliffhanger?I've given the book three stars because after I reached the mid-point, I started to get a little bit interested in the story.  The first half took two weeks for me to get through; the second half took a few hours.  I kept reading, desperately hoping that the story would blossom, that something would finally be explained.  I'm still disappointed with the way this book ended, but I did enjoy reading some parts of it.  Fred and George and their Skiving Snackboxes had me smiling to myself.  Professor Umbridge was deliciously nasty.  Hagrid's newest ""project"" was sort of amusing.  And I liked Rowling's clever literal use of a metaphor for death.  But, overall, it was not enough.I hope Book 6 is a lot shorter, a lot more exciting, and a lot less depressing (although, judging by the tone set in the last two books, I don't think things are going to get any lighter).

Year 5, while good, is the first to feel as if it's ""the middle of the story.""  I have faith that JK Rowling will make the most of the seeds planted in Year 5 in later books, but Year 5 does stand weaker alone.  I agree with many of the points made in the negative reviews here, so I will try and highlight some I haven't read.Spoilers:(...)My other problem with the story is that after creating such great villains in Fudge and Umbridge, we really never get to enjoy their downfall.  After creating a (...) state in Hogwarts and admitting to releasing dementors on Harry, Umbridge should be in Azkaban.  Likewise, Fudge should be charged with corruption and abuse of power.  I'm hopeful that these threads are at least visited in Year 6, but to not have these events in Year 5 makes for an unsatisfactory feeling.Likewise, there is no followup on the Percy Weasley thread.  While I am sure that this, too, will be in Year 6, it doesn't seem fair to the reader to make us wait 2-4 years for this conclusion.  The same goes for the results of the O.W.L. testing.

The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldemort's return, and has installed one of its members, Dolores Umbridge, as a new professor to suppress any rumors of Voldemort's return. Umbridge makes a great villain and, as the book goes on, she gains more and more power at Hogwarts.Harry spends most of the book feeling angry and resentful--not just because of Umbridge, but because he feels secrets are being kept from him, and because of his confusing relationship with Cho Chang. Meanwhile, Harry's godfather Sirius Black is frustrated because, for his own protection, he must remain at his house throughout the book. It all adds up, in my opinion, to a little too much whining and self-pity.This is a good book that becomes very suspenseful in its last 200 pages or so, but it does not have the same sustained excitement as earlier books. It is 870 pages long, and a couple hundred could easily have been cut. A subplot about Hagrid and giants is simply uninteresting. Many new wizards are introduced and given little to do. And it takes 200 pages just to get to Hogwarts. But you do learn a lot: about Neville, Aunt Petunia, Professor Snape, and others.

It's been said by reviewers in several newspapers and online news sites that Harry is a lot angrier in this installment, and I must agree.  This is not, however, directionless angst scribbled by someone who can only imagine what her characters are feeling.  Rowling, perhaps by virtue of how long she spent on Book 5, perhaps by knowing the characters she's created so thoroughly, gives us a very human portrait of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and all our old favorites.  The characters are fully realized, with real reactions, real joy, real anger, and real pain.Rowling not only manages to weave this all together coherently, but also gives us some new faces, and a delightful running joke about various characters' responses to the use of You-Know-Who's real name.  The dialogue rings true; not only is it completely natural and unstilted, but it also is remarkably faithful (intentionally or not) to the deliveries of the actors in the films!Harry faces some even trickier issues in Book 5; new facts about his family, the percolating hormones and emotions that come at the age of 15 or so, and, as mentioned elsewhere, the death of someone close to him.

Rowling's Harry Potter books are much more akin to Roald Dahl's quirky, alternately lighthearted and dark children's  stories.  However, that's not to say Rowling's books aren't well-written,  enormously entertaining and fun.  They are.  In fact, I can honestly say  that very few books of late have delighted me as much -- *especially* the  CD versions.  For as much as I enjoy *reading* the Harry Potter books (and  I have them all in print form), I love *hearing* them even more.  Jim  Dale's readings (especially the briskly-paced and richly charactered third  book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) have to be heard to be  believed.  Dale is a master storyteller.  He switches between characters  seamlessly, giving each one a different voice and personality.  His English  accent is a delight, and the pronounciations are crisp.  I especially enjoy  hearing the voices of Draco Malfoy, Hagrid and Professors Dumbledore, Snape  and McGonagall (who has a delightful brogue).  I recently purchased the  third book on CD in anticipation of my 3-hour drive (each way!) to Chicago  for a conference.  I loaded up my car's CD changer and listened all the way  down and back, hanging on every word.  Dale's fabulous reading turned what  could have been a long, uneventful trip into a delightful escape to  Hogwarts.  In fact, when I returned home, I didn't want to get out of my  car ... and, I'm nearly ashamed to say, kept looking for excuses to run  errands just so I could continue listening to the exciting story unfold!  Rowling's books seem tailor-made for *hearing*, as if she wrote them  specifically to be read aloud.  So if you've ever wanted to try an audio  book, and if you enjoy reading the Harry Potter series, I highly recommend  Jim Dale's presentations.  Thankfully, the audio versions are UNABRIDGED so  you can enjoy every single word.  I hope Dale continues to be the reader  for the Harry Potter series.  I can't imagine any other voice for them.  He's a perfect match for Rowling's words.  By the way, I'm 39 years old.  And I was raised on science fiction and fantasy books.  I rank the Harry  Potter books right up there with some of my all-time favorites.  As I said  in the beginning, Rowling's books are not as deep or clever as many of the  classics of the genre, but they're every bit as entertaining in their own  right.

Granted, I encourage my boys to read with Harry Potter because the books are a soild introduction to good literature, not necessarily a learning experience of good manners.  Looking deeper, the book takes some unexpected turns and I think that complaints of boredom are not well founded.  Book Five is definately a step up from Book Four.  Indeed, all the endearing qualities of the first four books has finally been combined in the Order of the Phoenix.For the reader concerned about the unpleasant attitude that reoccurs in the books, it is a good opportunity to consider the pressures of popularity.  The pressures on Harry Potter are a keen reflection of that of a childhood celebrity.  There is a good opportunity to discuss with children stress management.

"4358",5,731234,FALSE,"Harry grows up.I'll start this by saying that I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I think the books have been paced perfectly not only prosaically but also in terms of sophistication. As Harry gets older, his life gets more and more complicated. That includes his homelife with the Dursleys, his relationships with Ron and Hermione, even with potential love interests. Add in the increasing difficulty of his course work, and the rising threat level of ""He Who Must Not Be Named,"" and it's enough to make a lad scream (which Harry does several times in OOTP.) However, nowhere is this increased depth portrayed in a more perfect manner than in the exchanges between Professor Dumbledore and Harry towards the end of this, the fifth chapter of the septology. The language and ideas used by JK Rowling in OOTP reflect not only Harry's growth, but also that of her audience. These books aren't just for children anymore.Despite any negative feelings one may have at the thought of reading ""a children's book,"" or trying to avoid them simply because they are so popular, I strongly urge everyone and anyone to look beyond those feelings. I will be the first to admit that the first two books (HP and The Sorcerer's Stone & HP and The Chamber Of Secrets,) are fairly simple. As I alluded to earlier, I believe that this was always JK Rowling's plan, and one must keep in mind that Harry is only 11 and 12 years of age respectively in the first two novels. Once the groundwork of the first two books is laid, the story arc really kicks into gear, and the books which follow, (HP and The Prisoner Of Azkaban, HP and The Goblet of Fire, HP and The Order Of The Phoenix)are some of the most satisfying fantasy/adventure tales I've ever read.I give Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix my highest endorsement, and am waiting most impatiently for the sixth installment.",FALSE,2003,1513

When we heard that this installation of the Harry Potter series was going to be more dark, Ms. Rowling was certainly not joking!The opening ""pre-school"" chapters were fast paced indeed and left  quite a few bombshells for being so early in the book.The Hagrid story line took new turns and was enjoyable. I am now pondering what may happen in the future with the Hagrid/Maxime line.I really want to smack Percy Weasley quite soundly.We do learn new things about Snape, but it's not what everyone was predicting. ;) Wonderful unexpected surprise though.We also see Lily and James, also not in roles or acting as one would think. I admired how Ms. Rowling kept blindsiding me with these unexpected twist in nearly every chapterWe see a new home that is exciting, scary, and will probably have a future role in later books.Perhaps the part I most enjoyed about this book was seeing the interaction with our ""famous trio"" with students from other houses, some of whom we have seen little or nothing of before. I was impressed by the bravery and loyalty shown by many of the students, all while taking the risk of dedfying the Wizarding Government to follow their hearts - and to be loyal to Dumbledore. Both Dumbledore and Harry are slandered quite badly in this version all at the hands of Fudge & Co. (Percy included) and his control of The Daily Prophet. I loved the student rebellion and quite liked Fred & George's denoument. Classic, and it seems Flitwick had some apprectiation for it - as well as many in the school.The play on words for Prof. Umbridge was a hoot. I took it as a sign of how Fudge has been taking umbrage at Dumbledore's assertations of LV's return.Neville Longbottom finally starts coming into his own, which I was quite pleased to see. We also learn something interesting about him as well.Since the characters are older, we also get more into teen love life, and we see bits from a few here that make the story more interesting. It's nice to see ""real"" teens, not sanitizedd ones who somehow are unaffected by adolescents hormones.Hermione's advice about handling girls is wonderful. I hope that Harry and Ron pay attention. :)Quidditch fans may be disappointed as there are not many play by plays in this volume as there were in books 1-3. I guess it makes sense as large as the book already is, and well, the teams have havoc as well from the meddlesome Prof. Umbridge.Malfoy becomes worse than ever, especially as his ranking in the school improves under Prof Umbridge.Dumbledore does indeed spill the beans to harry, but again, this does not turn out the way many predict. It was is quite moving nonetheless. Haryy's anger, Dumbledore's fear, and love all play well in what was a tear-jerking chapter.The death was sad of course, but again, different from what most have guessed. The whole book in general was far scarier than the others. Government takes over where it shouldn't and that is always scary. Not a bad lesson for current times I guess. that part was almost as scary as the LV story line.For me, what strikes me is that love, loyalty, friendship , bravery and a willingness to put oneself in harms way to help a friend can save the day even when fighting forces that *should* have superior skills.

"4363",3,731190,FALSE,"SUMMARY: You may be deciding whether to get the book now or after it is available in Paperback. I would recommend the latter. This book is good, as it advances the plotline we have anxiously followed. However, it is nowhere near the value of its predecessors. Thus, it is good to read once but not so great for re-reading.On the other hand, if you choose to wait for paperback, you must beware of spoilers. There are several prominent plot twists (such as character deaths) which would be unfortunate to learn prematurely. If this worries you, feel free to get the book now, as Amazon is running a spectacular deal on the book.GOOD: This story is a real page-turner. Once again, Rowling inserts just enough colorful insights into the magical world, that we really feel that we are living in a spectacular dream-world. This is the transition-point of the series, where the final pieces of the background are falling into place. You simply cannot put this book down when the answer to yet another question might be on the next page.BAD: This book may suffer from having TOO many points to cover. Upon finishing the book, I felt quite unfulfilled. Not only are we left with the standard cliffhangers for forthcoming books, there are far too many missed opportunities to explore our favorite characters. As an example, fans have anticipated the exploration of Harry's romantic crush on rival Quiddich-player Cho Chang. One would hope that Harry's first love would change him, and provide new challenges to his character development. We could see how to woo a girl in the Wizarding World- what gifts should a boy send, where to take her on a date. But instead of this development, we get very little dialogue between the two. No challenges are resolved to any extent, and Harry never seems concerned with Cho more than 5 pages before and after his infrequent dealings with her.Likewise, we learn early on that Hermione and Ron are chosen as school prefects. One would think this a perfect jumping-off point to enrich the Hogwart's experience. When do they patrol the corridors? Do they get special privileges or learn special spells? Yet Hermione's character takes the rarest of opportunities to boss kids around, while Ron never seems a prefect at all. Instead of bringing magical miscreants into line, Hermione spends her time teaching Ron and Harry how to prioritize their homework assignments.Problems like those above were really a shame, as I think the author missed out on some great chances to expand the breadth of her world. We read these books to escape from reality. I'm sorry, but I am not compelled to re-read a book where I spend more time vicariously experiencing magical, homework-planners than patrolling the halls of a haunted magic-school.

The movie did not do this book justice as far as these minute details are concerned, in my opinion, though it did throw in more of the time travel elements than the book did.I love the darker edge of the HP series that starts in this book. Harry is growing up, not a baby anymore, and JK doesn't treat him like he is. He goes through real adolescent issues, obviously exagerated due to his situation. He faces life and death as usualy, choosing what's right over what's easy.

And how does he deal with it?  Awkwardly, driven by love and anger, joy and sorrow, and with a lot of help from his friends.  Indignities, injustices and homework are but a few of the burdens heaped upon Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville and the rest at a startling rate, creating a teenage emotional miasma that swirls and pulses through the book, giving it a palpable vicariousness that had this 35-year-old reader checking the mirror for acne and spell-induced hexes when he was finished...and wishing butterbeer, chocolate frogs, friendship, loyalty and adventure had been this plentiful when I went to school.",FALSE,2003,1468

While the book was just as good a read as the first four books, the reason I liked this book the most is because instead of portraying an idealized hero, J. K. Rowling has done a superb job portraying a realistic person (Harry Potter) and his reactions and attitudes in a very trying circumstance. Harry was destined to be a hero, tragic or otherwise. He was born to it. But he was also human, who was experiencing growing pain when it comes to morals, friendships, and romances. He took out his anger on his two best friends and the professor who he detested. Some readers were critical of his behaviors. Some think he whined too much. But this is what a real teenager does, more or less, in real life. This is what we all go through in our lives when we were at Harry's age, without the magic and the prophecy of course. I especially liked the part where Harry accidentally discovered a dark side of his father when he was at Harry's age. He was shocked because it is the first time that he realized that his father was not perfect. Don't we all make that discovery at some point of our lives? And aren't we all very different person (for the better hopefully) when we grow up comparing to when we were teenagers? I admire J. K.

The reader gets a better perspective of Harry and what he feels and thinks.  Also, for the first time, Harry's faith in those he loves is shaken, something everyone goes through.  This book is more about Harry's coming of age than other books have been, and it features more about Voldemort as well.  This book will give die-hard Harry fans answers to some questions that we've been wondering for a long time.  The only draw-back of this book is the length, 870 pages.

At the start of the book we once again find Harry hating life with his muggle aunt & uncle and eagerly looking forward to the start of the school year when he can return to Hogwarts.  The book introduces us to several new characters including a new Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin and a Divination professor.  The Prisoner in the title is Sirius Black, an escapee from Azbakan, a prison for witches and wizards.  Just before the start of the school year, Harry overhears some people talking in the Leaky Cauldron that Black is after him.  For this reason, Harry will be watched over very closely during the school year at Hogwarts.Harry, Ron, and Hermione once again have their share of magical adventure but with a few unexpected twists and turns this time around!

The Harry Potter books are literature, and they deserve to be treated as such.  Just because they happen to appeal to everyone doesn't make them any less worthy of inclusion to the historical canon of Great Books.  These are wonderful books - richly plotted, full of distinct and lovable characters, and much smarter than first glance would indicate.And so we arrive at Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the first and last 870-page book I will likely ever read (unless JK Rowling ups the page number again with Year 6 of Harry Potter's adventures).  Like the previous four books, it puts you into a parallel universe you're unlikely to want to leave.  Rowling's genius was to make Harry Potter someone who lives, theoretically, in today's world.  It makes relating to him a whole lot easier, and that helps because in Order Harry isn't such a lovable little scamp.  He pouts, he rages, he's nasty to friends, and he makes stupid mistakes.  He's become a wizard version of Kevin Arnold from ""The Wonder Years"".  No matter.  Potter's adventures here are just as intoxicating as ever, and as the series continues to darken in tone, it's beginning to take on even greater and more complex meaning.For sheer excitement, Order isn't superior to the last two installments of the series.  Goblet of Fire and Prisoner of Azkaban were more fast-paced and entertaining books.  But it's worth sacrificing a bit of action to see that Harry Potter is a more textured, complicated character than ever before.It's worth noting that this is the first Potter book to be published since the film versions of the first two books have been produced.  It's a sad thing, in a way, because the unique images each readers will conjure up for every character is bound to be replaced somewhat by the actors who portrayed Ron Weasly, Hermione, Snape, McGonagall, and so on.  It robs the reader of just a touch of imagination.  Then again, that will hardly stop the Potter freight train from rolling along.

Although, the newly self-appointed Grand Inquisitor of Hogwarts, Miss Dolores Jane Umbridge may be just as bad.... ""Hem hem...""As the harry Potter series progresses, Rowling's storytelling has grown from quaint and brief, to hefty novels filled with rich detail and more strident pacing. At 870 pages, it remains an amazing feat that she has still crafted such an exciting adventure! The previous novel GOBLET OF FIRE also had a large increase in page count, but the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX handles it better, having less final act exposition that weighed down the last 200 pages.The story follows Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, a school for magicians. But before he can get there, harry gets into trouble rescuing his cousin Dudley from a dementor, an act which places him in front of a tribunal at the Ministry of magic. Things hardly improve when he meets this years Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, a cringe-worthy micromanager who later becomes the Grand Inquisitor!

Through it all, Hogwarts remains a world of magic, fun and entertaining to discover.If you happen to be short on time, all the books have been `performed' on Audio CD by Jim Dale (Pete's Dragon). He does a wonderful job of reading the novel, word for word, using voice characterizations to help your enjoyment.As of this writing, the book has not been adapted to film but it surely will and will obviously be cut up extremely. After all, an accurate, 25 hour version will only please purists.While the films leave me as somewhat of a Muggle, I have enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books (six at this writing). Author J.K.

"4381",5,731222,FALSE,"I highly recommend this book for all readers of all ages. However, I suggest you read the first two books to help put this one in context. Rowling's style of writing is simple and straightforward but you forget you're reading ""a children's book."" The story and the separate world she creates will suck you in and keep you wanting more.  The hero of the story is just a regular kid (aside from the fact that he's a wizard) and is someone we can all relate to.  For this reason we care what happens to him, and we want to see what he does in each situation because we wonder if we would react the same way.I found this book to be the most enjoyable of the first five simply because it's the most fun. The last 30 pages are the best. I've read it again and again.  You learn more about the wizarding world, more characters are created for you to get to know and love (or hate).  On the first read the ending doesn't seem to make much sense but the second time around it all comes together, perfectly planned and constructed (I don't want to give anything away, so just read it!).One of the things I love about this series is that the books are also marvelously constructed mysteries.  You start to see a pattern after the second book and each one you read afterwards you wonder ""Where's the surprise this time?""  I try to guess it each time and each time I'm completely taken unawares.  Each book has an ending you never would have suspected, but on a second read you realize how well it was all planned, and can't believe you never saw it coming.  This one is no exception, and in fact is even better planned than the first two.  A second read is also recommended.Another thing done well in this book is the character development and aging of the characters.  Even on the cover, you can tell Harry looks a little bit older.  His thoughts and actions are more mature and you get to watch all the kids grow up.  After awhile you feel like they are your friends.Bottom line: stop reading reviews of this book and read the book itself!  You won't be disappointed.",FALSE,2003,1501

Instead, they must work it out for themselves, and they do so splendidly. Thankfully, this more fulfilling type of storytelling continues into the sequels, where mystery plays a useful role (e.g. the prophecy, the graveyard duel) but does not resolve the heroes' problems.The movie, which was just released, lacks only in its background between Harry's dad and his friends, but it also surpasses the book with the time turning sequence.

I don't know, and I hope that for the next book Rawlings takes heed and doesn't try to overstep herself.Many people have commented about the excellent portrayal of Harry Potter as a teenager growing up with angst, anger and emotions; I think it was poorly constructed.  Sure, teenagers have a right to be angry, but I just felt frustrated watching Harry interact and wallow in self pity through his 5th year at Hogwarts.  I think Harry was portrayed as a normal 15 year old boy.  I don't read books about normal boys, if I wanted that, I could look back to my teenage years. Rather literature should accmoplish something: should arrive somewhere.  I think Rawlings had the power in this book to help many teens through this adolescent anger period, and get beyond the anger, if only she had tired to convey a message instead of embracing and enjoying the anger.Overall I think the book was poorly constructed, and probably could have 250+ pages taken out without severly damaging the story line.  I think the paradigms should be reviewed (malfoy and harry; snape and harry, etc.) and something new and exciting should be developed.  I don't think the characters grew as much as everyone thought they did; and I hope that JK puts together a better effort in the future.",FALSE,2003,1465
"4394",5,730445,FALSE,"I could rate this one the best book in the Harry Potter series, but I still have not read the fourth one. The author probably has realized that many adults are already inmersed in this ""child book"" series, so this book shows a lot more mature and complicated plotline (eventhough children will understand it as well, and maybe better than an adult).The reason why this books is so important for toddlers as well as adults is that it is a masterpiece of pure imagination that revolves around values like friendship, tolerance and boldness, as well as providing a world beyond our wildest dreams, full of characters that will make us laugh and worry as well, while we are sticked to the exciting plot.I guess people (including myself) like these books so much because they provide a world that pushes our imagination to the limit, as well as characters wich we can identify with (everybody had that particular teacher that seemed to hate you), providing an escape valve from this crooked place we Muggles have lo live in.",FALSE,2001,724
"4396",5,731933,FALSE,"I loved the darker themes in this episode of Harry Potter.  Harry's developement was wonderfully realistic especially his issues with attitude, authority, dating, and anger.  He almost resemebled Anakin from Star Wars in his temper and moodiness, which I loved!  Something unexpected happened as I read this book, because I found myself wanting to hit Harry over the head and ask what was wrong with him.  I thought the developing relationship between the three friends wasn't as obvious as it could be, but I definitely loved the situation with the Weasleys. Percy leaving, Mrs. Weasley's fears for her family, and Mr. Weasley's increasing troubles at work made the book exciting and reader's sympathetic.  THe formation of Dumbeldore's Army was a great idea for the book and is one of the most memorable events in the entire series.  I was also fascinated with the secret workings of the Order of the Phoenix and the fight against not only the wicked Voldemort in bodily form but also a media denying the truth as well as a government not working properly.This book was extremely suspensefull and I wasn't at all dissapointed in its outcome or plot.

It is basically the same style but with a few allterations. Order of Phoenix, it seems to me is more a physcholgical thriller than a childrens book. it makes you mind work and has a very intricate plot. After reading this book i looked back at the previous 4 and even goblet of fire seemed to have the simplest plot!! The plot is very complex and many strange happenins occure durring this year. but may i warn you, this is a much darker book. It seems to take a minor tone right from the begining and that minor tone never leaves. Harry is growing up, and is braving through the pains of adolesence. he is a lot more angry and is prone to throw tantrums, and at first it seemed a little out of character to me but then i realized that it, in some cases, was perfectly justified to react angrily because so many bad things have happend to harry in the past 5 years that it all just kind of builds up and explodes in the ""order of the phoenix"". I also found it to be quite depressing in the end w/ the death and all. i wont' say who died because i don't want to ruin it but it made the book take turn for the worse for harry. overall this was a great book and really showed harry in an adolesence stage all teens can related to, from his angry tantrums, to his first date and finally his dealing of death. I would highly reccomend this book, but i would also highly reccomend reading the previous 4 in the series. It would not make ANY sense at all really if you didn't have any background knowledge on the harry potter subject and it would make for a more enjoyable read. Also, don't be intimidated by its size. i roared right through this book in 2 days!! i was pacing my self too, i could have finished it in one! once again i would highly reccomend this book to read/buy",FALSE,2003,1468
"4399",4,731899,FALSE,"Harry Potter is growing up, and his world at Hogwart's is becoming a dark world of political conspiracy and betrayal.  When the series started, Hogwart's School of Wizardry was a magical place for the awestruck boy first learning of his magical heritage and ability.  He made new friends, met wonderful teachers and mentors such as Minerva McGonnagal and Albus Dumbledore.In Order of the Phoenix, Hogwart's is no longer a secure place.  Even the teachers are in fear for their jobs and the safety of Headmaster Dumbledore, as the sinister Dolores Umbridge takes over Hogwart's on authority of the Ministry of Magic.  Harry must rely only on himself, but he is truly venturing into insanity with his strange dreams that connect him to the mind of Lord Voldemort.  Harry also is increasing irrational and shouts at Hermione and Ron.Phoenix is a violent book, full of painful and sometimes fatal magic attacks on many beloved characters.  It is a book that holds your attention from beginning to end, but there are so many characters it is difficult to keep track of all of them.  The plot is complicated and unsettling.

This book has many twists and revelations and very tense, suspensful adventures with many near-deaths and (as reported) the death of another character who we have gotten to know and love even more than Cedric Diggory.  Harry is definately going through adolescence (complete with grumpy outbursts at his friends and an inability to keep his temper with certain nasty professors) and the world of Hogwarts is changing as the Ministry of Magic tries to discredit Dumbledore in an attempt to vainly deny that You-Know-Who is back.Some teasers for you (without spoilers):*See Harry's first kiss*Learn more about Harry's dad and Snape*Enjoy finding out what Fred and George do with the 1000 Galleons Harry gave them at the end of Book 4and... best of all...

"4406",5,731925,FALSE,"God knows that Amazon has enough reviews on this book, but I recently read OOTP in anticipation for the newly-released sixth Potter book, the Half-Blood Prince. This being the second time I delved into the magnificent world that J.K. Rowling has masterfully created with Order of the Phoenix, I took notice of many different things that I didn't originally notice during my first read. There are hints spread throughout the book of things to come, and these clues make the book much enjoyable the second time around.What hasn't already been said about the Harry Potter books? The hype is most definitely worth it, as each Potter novel seems to outdo the next. The story of OOTP is much cloudier and darker from the previous four books -- in fact, I would go as far as to say that the plot is little too bleak. If there's one thing I wasn't entirely fond of, it would have to be the fact that Rowling seemingly tries almost too hard to rush the book into being more ""mature"". Also, the jump from Harry being a relatively easy-going (if not admittedly stressed) wizard  in the fourth book to being a whiny, adolescent wizard in OOTP comes as somewhat shocking, and definitely surprised me.The plot, on the other hand, is very rich and vivid regardless of the darkness. This is without a doubt the series best quality, aside from perhaps the characters which only contribute further. Hermione, Harry, and Ron are of course all back, along with a new assortment of characters. Practically every character is given more ""air time"" in OOTP, and it's good to see that some characters were fleshed out more -- like Ginny, for example. Characters that were used simply to fill in gaps in previous books now have important roles in the story. One of the more prominent characters is killed off in OOTP, and that is another complaint I have with the book. Usually I would welcome plot twists with open arms, regardless of whether a beloved character is killed, but the death seems rather pointless. It almost seems like Rowling is killing off someone just to fill pages, rather than to actually contribute to further happenings.Overall, the fifth Potter book is very engrossing. It suffers from a few flaws, but none which are too serious. As engrossing as Prison of Azkaban and with as much edginess as Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix is a welcome chapter to the Harry Potter series!",FALSE,2005,2204
"4408",2,731200,FALSE,"I am a very devoted fan of this series but I noticed in book 4 that it was just starting to drop. In Order of the Phoenix, I was convinced I was reading a fake.I mean, everyone likes a little bit of emotion in books, but too much makes me sick and I bet it's the same for you too. As another reviewer put it, Harry Potter needs Prozac. Kids can deal with this book, it's not really very violent, but don't waste your money, wait until the paperback comes out or you can get it at the library. People should start realizing that the magic can't last forever. Plus the addition of the two movies made it harder to imagine the characters and settings, almost as if your imagination is dictated. Reading is not school. When you read for pleasure, your imagination should stretch. I found it hard to stretch with this installment.If you want a good book with a good ending that you can understand, a good villian who does really villian-like things, and a good plot that makes sense and doesn't take 800+ pages to glorify on, please just read Lord of the Rings, Eragon, or something by Garth Nix.

Yes, they take place in middle school, and yes, they deal with wizards and flights of fancy and yes, the main characters are not even teenagers.  However, Rowling has created books with an excellent sense of plot, she throws in twists and turns that certainly threw me for a number of loops.  She is amazing at crafting characters that are engaging, original and a lot of fun to spend a few hours with.  To top all of this fact, let us not forget that these are books in a series.  In the first book there is a sense of safety, that these are children's books and that a wave of a magic wand is all that is needed to make everything come out alright.  But this series is slowly shifting as the books continue, and there is a presence looming at the end of the fourth book that clearly shows us that Dumbledore, the schoolmaster who bails Harry and his friends out here and there during their adventures, is NOT going to be able to wave his magic wand and make everything better.  The stakes are raised by the end of the fourth book, the danger is very real and an epic battle is shaping up between good and evil.

"4413",5,731605,FALSE,"The third book in the Harry Potter series has often been called the best by fans. I felt it quite a good read though not the best. The theme is shot down into the netherworld with the introduction of the Dementors, the emotionless spectors that guard the wizard prison Azkaban. Their introduction comes as Sirius Black (the prisoner of Azkaban) escapes from the prison, becoming the first to do so, and sets his sights on Harry. Convicted thirteen years ago of the betrayal of Lily and James Potter, Harry's parents, he spent those thirteen years lusting revenge on Harry, whom he thinks is the only person keeping Lord Voldemort from his rebirth.This is definately my favorite book of the 90s (the release date Sept. 1, 1999) and stands as my third favorite Potter book. The length (longer than both the first and second) seems quite reasonable for the material. Nothing is rushed (though the movie does concentrate less on subplot) and the result is yet another masterpiece from JK Rowling. This book also sports my second favorite of the Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers. This year's teacher is Remus J. Lupin who mysteriously falls ill once every few weeks.Though the Dementors are throughly evil and the themes include betrayal, murder, and revenge, I'd say this book should be fine for any mature child over the age of 8.",FALSE,2004,1884
"4414",5,731189,FALSE,"""Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix"" was a whopping 870 pages - the longest ever in the series, 100 pages longer than the fourth book, ""The Goblet of Fire,"" and it seemed to be a very quick read! While, it wasn't the best (""The Prisoner of Azkaban is my personal favorite), it was still magnificent with tons of twists and turns, and you won't be let down at all.The name of the book ""The Order Of The Phoenix,"" comes from the name of an elite group of wizards (led by Albus Dumbledore) who fight the good fight against Voldemort and his deatheaters, and unfortunately the Ministry of Magic, who has started to become corrupt, hating Dumbledore and trying to revoke his headmastership of Hogwarts.I won't get into too many details of the book, I would hate to spoil it for anyone reading, but there are several new characters, especially adults. Some of them are: Nymphadora Tonks, a young witch who is a Metamorphmagus (meaning she can change appearences instantly without a wand or potion), Kingsley Shacklebolt, a tall, black wizard who is undercover in the Ministry of Magic, and of course...Dolores Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, who is probably the most cruel and hateable character we've had yet. Starting out as merely a teacher, she begins to accumulate more and more control thanks to Cornelius Fudge, minister of the Ministry of Magic.Harry is more mature in this book in some ways, in others less. He is more angry, therefore having a harder time controlling his emotions. He gets a bit more rebellious and therefore getting himself in more trouble, but at the same time learning more, and in most cases making the right choices. He also begins to see more of Cho Chang, the girl he has had a crush on since fourth or third year.Hermoine and Ron's characters don't seem to change much, but Neville Longbottom does quite a bit, and we meet a new interesting girl called Luna Lovegood, who we don't see too much of, but there is something curiously intriguing about her. Draco Malfoy is little to be seen, but he seems to be more evil than ever, and I predict there will be a duel between him and Harry by the end of the series.We see a lot of Professor Severus Snape in this book, and get to learn more of why his hatred for Harry is so strong. Hagrid gave me quite a laugh along with the Divination teacher, Trelawney. We got to see teachers act in this book as we never have been able to before, including the Hogwart's favorite, Albus Dumbledore, who we get to witness act more human than ever.The only reason why this book wasn't as good as the others, I think, was because everything seemed more rushed than before. Although it was 870 pages and it was wonderfully written (J.K. Rowling hasn't disappointed me yet), it didn't seem to have the natural flow like the past books have, and so many of the happenings in the book seemed too ironic; too coincidental. And yes, it might not be fair, but the death in the end (Yes, there IS a death, and one of the big characters) really disappointed me; my favorite character was killed.But even with the minor problems I thought the book had, it still deserved five stars.

"4415",5,731192,FALSE,"First, this review is a bit vague.  That vagueness is on purpose as I don't wish to ruin any of the surprises in the fifth installment of the Harry Potter series.  For serious fans of this series, the wait for this book has seemed very long.  The good news is that the book was worth the wait.While the first few books of the series were very binary, the Order of the Phoenix reveals a much more complex world.  While there is still a pronounced struggle between good and evil, the Rowling's characters seem more human as we learn about their weaknesses as well as their strengths.  Through the book, themes and storylines continue to develop that have been woven throughout the first four books.  The most interesting theme is the continued exploration of the power of love as it relates to the way that the characters interact.In a coming of age story (which book 5 is), perhaps the most important element is the suspense that builds as the characters move through the story.  If one doesn't feel that the characters might mature in unhealthy versus healthy ways, then the book lacks the power and honesty that makes it a true coming of age story.  Here, Rowling's honesty in dealing with the characters presents a believable (although sometime painful) picture of not only the wizarding world but also our world.The 5th year students at Hogwarts have to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels).  While the students have to wait until July for the results of their exams, we can say that Rowling passes the 5th book in this series with an ""O"" for Outstanding!",FALSE,2003,1471

I waited in line for like 2 hours to get it then of course hurried and read it in a day, so of course I missed all kinds of important stuff. I was upset so I stayed away from Harry Potter completely for a couple of months. Then I decided to read it for a second time and WOW! I get in these little stages where Im obsessed with the books and I read all of them back to back. ""The Goblet of Fire"" is still by far my favorite. So much happens. In ""Order of the Phoenix"" you can obviously tell that the characters are growing up and starting to mature quickly. Personally I think that Hermione and Ron are developing a bit of a crush on each other, but who knows what J.K. will have that grow into. Harry and Cho is kind of a complicated subject. He likes her but he still seems to be in that ""girls have cooties"" stage. I was sad that Sirius ""died"" but I have convinced myself that he is coming back in some form and it will have something to do with the mirror that Sirius gives Harry in the beginning of the book. I know that a main character dies in ""half blood prince"" due to come out on June 16the (I am sooo excited) but Im not sure as to who it might be. J.K. has already confirmed that it will not be Harry, Hermione, or Ron. Maybe HAgrid, though I hope not.

Toss in ""teachers that hate me,"" incompetent teachers, and general teen agnst and you have a truly great story. It took a second reading to realize just what a great job the author did in portraying the roughest times any young person can have.

The first book was good, the second book not so good, the third book was very good, and the fourth book was the least good.  The fifth book, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", is enormous - nearly 900 pages (in hardback).  It has taken me over two weeks to finish.  Thankfully, this book clearly outclasses all the other Harry Potter books - full kudos to the author.In this latest Harry Potter installment we have intriguing, and often hilarious, political in-fighting at Hogwarts (the wizardry school).  Almost everyone seems to be out to get poor Harry.  Harry's near love life is going south.  The plot percolates nicely, with various twists and turns.  The characterizations of the many secondary characters are uniformly excellent.  The story is thrilling, sad, and hilarious in equal measures.  However I would say with 'Phoenix' the Harry Potter series no longer for people under, say, fifteen years of age.

"4423",5,731189,FALSE,"[If you haven't read the previous books, don't read this review]I was nervous about this one, there are literally millions of children counting on its being not just a good read but  a worthy continuation. I'm relieved to report that it comes through on all counts.This is a big step forward for Rowling. More than ever, Harry isn't just an action figure, he's a real person, and it's not just him. Snape, for example, remains a complex yet consistent character whom Rowling steadfastly refuses to sentimentalize. Even in places where cliche seems unavoidable -- Harry's ""love interest"" -- it doesn't happen.Harry is a real teenager here (as are his friends), with quicksilver changes of mood, and it's a great thing that the author simply 'shows' rather than constantly 'explaining.' One unexpected pleasure is Rowling's fine evocation of political division within a close-knit community. (If you've been through it, you'll know what I mean.)One big problem with some of the previous books has been the 'revelation scene' at the climax, where the villain talks and talks and talks until the cavalry comes to Harry's rescue. This was a symptom of a deeper problem: important parts of the plot turned on details which were essentially irrelevant to Harry's personal story. For example, in book 3, which turns on time-travel, there's no mention of time-travel until the final act. In book 4, which turns on ""Mad-Eye Moody"" really being a villain in disguise, too much depends on the exact manner of the villain's escape from prison, and even his exact name. None of that here, which is a good thing.Also good is a de-emphasis of Quidditch -- since we knew Harry had to win most of the time, it became too predictable.I will say there are a couple of places where Rowling nods, where it's not clear how a lost item was recovered, or how an (offstage) battle was won; and there are more than a few places in the last chapters which show signs of editorial fatigue. But I'm so glad that the book is finally here that these don't matter much.Parents: although there's nothing gruesome here -- like Wormtail cutting off his hand in Book 4 -- I think most children under 11 will find too much of the book dull or confusing.

I felt no sympathy for him at all throughout the book.  The long-awaited revelation comes in the last 30 pages or so - and even then it's no great surprise.  I'm sure that even thinking these thoughts is blasphemy, but I feel that the spirit of the first three books is being squashed.

All the requirements were there:  a struggle between good and evil; the power of love vs power for its own sake.  The plot was concise; the narrative compelling.  Descriptive details will forever leave the image of the Great Hall with its hundreds of floating candles and enchanted ceiling in our minds.We were forgiving in the fourth book.  A rushed deadline and a lack of tight editing turned book 4 (Goblet of Fire) into an overly long hodge-podge.  The decent into ""pop"" fiction had begun.  We have the International Quidditch Cup, where we are given a parallel to the modern soccer match turned slug-fest.  Too much time is wasted getting from the first page to the last.  Side plots such as rights for house elves may be necessary to the overall plot of the series, but the plight of the house elves could have been presented in a more concise way-as was done with a few Dobby scenes in book 2.Which brings us to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  Rather than a return to the classic feel of the first three books, Rowling's Phoenix only carries us further down the road of ""popular"" reading.  If I wanted to read a book about an angry young teen, I could have picked up any one of the novels that my 15 year old likes to read.  Angry boy from a tough background, misunderstood by his peers, disrespectful of authority, achieves redemption through strength of character.  Sound familiar?  While this might sell to the younger crowd, I think it loses it appeal across the generations and across time.  I don't think Harry has to suddenly develop this character flaw.  It would be more appropriate for Ron.  I don't think ALL teens behave this way.In addition to the irritation of Harry constantly being nanoseconds away from his next angry outburst and just about everyone speaking with a snarl, I was highly disappointed with the language of this book.  I imagine that in fifty years it will be nearly impossible to decipher all the slang that Rowling has chosen to use.  One phrase not difficult to decipher is Uncle Vernon's:  ""Enough...effing...owls!!""  At first, one's eyes slide over the word ""effing.""  Perhaps it's one of those British words we don't understand.  But it becomes clear, as you think about it, that it's a substitute for that favorite four-letter f-word.  Yes, it's even what my own teens use when they don't want to get in trouble for ""the real thing.""  I can just imagine a class of 3rd graders being read to by their teacher.  Johnnie's hand goes up.  ""Mrs. Johnson, what does `effing' mean?""  What's the answer to that question?I noticed that the American version did much less ""translating"" than it has in the past.  Sneakers are referred to as trainers and sweaters as jumpers, as they are in the British version.  Maybe it's time we learned UK-speak.  I was immensely relieved, however, that the editors did change something that one of the Weasley twins said about the O.W.L.s (fifth year wizarding tests).  In the British version, we find out that during exams it's hard to ""keep your [..] up.""  Don't worry, in the American version, it's your ""spirits"" that are hard to keep up. But be warned in case you like to order the British version as a compliment.  Why would this phrase be used at all in a book such as this?  You might argue that it's the way teen boys talk.  I argue that it will keep the book from becoming a classic.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is little more than an exploration into the psyche of J.K. Rowling, the author.  It's no surprise to me that her mother died suddenly when she was young given the sudden and arbitrary way she killed off the designated character in this book.  And now that she has more money than the queen, she can dangle us all like puppets on her ""need to control"" string.  Complete secrecy regarding the plot, with only a few phrases released in advance.  Book reviewers were not allowed advanced copies.  Translators had to wait like the rest of us, delaying the release of foreign language versions until December.  Publishers of an early review are being sued for million of dollars for revealing plot details prior to the publication date.  Seems a bit silly now, doesn't it?Perhaps if the book had had a believable plot, more of the rest could be overlooked.  At the end of this book, the characters have simply aged one year.  There was no growth, no enlightenment.  The willingness of Rowling (a teacher by profession) to include a teacher who inflicts a punishment which draws the blood of a student turns my stomach. We are told things by Dumbledore that we didn't know previously (but could very easily have guessed), but his exposition only leaves us with more questions. Death, we learn, is arbitrary and sudden.  I picked that up in the last book.  Why couldn't the death in this book be sacrificial or serve some greater good.  Rowling's cryptic answers of ""Wait and see how it all plays out"" no longer suffice for me.It's really too bad that this series suffers from too much of Rowling working out her own issues.  In the end, this book will be remembered by time for the record-breaking sales and not for its literary value.As always, Jim Dale does an excellent job with the reading of the book.

Meanwhile, a lot of strange things are also happening to Harry.

My faith in JK Rowling's storytelling savvy never faltered, despite rumors and that incredibly lengthy, frustrating wait.  My high opinions of the first four books in the Harry Potter series convinced me that I was going to enjoy the fifth book.  It was only natural.  Now, after reading it, I have to say that it surprised me.  'Order of the Phoenix' wasn't quite what I had expected.  It absolutely blew me away.  Not only was the book so vivid and detailed and magical--Rowling's power of storytelling never ceases to amaze--the plot was always intriguing and often quite suspenseful, taking unexpected twists and turns that readers hardly could have predicted only pages before.  Harry is in his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and it seems as if nothing is as it should be.  He is unhappy, unfairly treated, lonely, miserable, and, on top of it all, plagued by a recurring nightmare.  Despite these low points in his life, humor and wit abound, especially through the antics of Fred and George Weasley, fellow Hogwarts students and mischief-makers extraordinaire.  Harry learns truths about the wizarding government and its stunning lack of justice, as well as truths about himself and the man who killed his parents and tried to murder him, Lord Voldemort.  The substance of the story was what got to me most, however.  Literature can be well-written, but well-written literature with a purpose and direction such as Rowling's work is hard to come by.  Her depiction of good-versus-evil has continued to improve with each book, and as I read the rising action and climax of 'Order of the Phoenix', I couldn't help but wondering excitedly what Rowling has in store for readers next.",FALSE,2003,1468

He yells a lot more, becomes a little self centered, and is altogether way more moody. And to top it all off, he is confused and angry.He does not know why he is bing forced to stay in his aunt and uncles' house. He does not know why Ron and Hermione keep avoiding his questions in their letters to him. He wants answers, desperately, but no one wants to give them to him.Harry is starting to get really depressed. So when a group of witches and wizards come to rescue him, he is relieved, thinking that he will finally get some answers. When they arrive at their destination, however, he only finds out that he is staying at the headquarters of the Order of the Pheonix, and that Voldemort is trying to build up his army and get a weapon that he did not have before.When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he begins having strange and frightening dreams. He dreams of a corridor illuminated in an eerie blue light, ending in a single door. He tries to reach the door, to open it... but he always wakes up. Snape begins giving him Occlumency lessons to try and block out the dreams.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, refuses to face the fact that You-Know-Who has returned. They believe that this is just a figment of Harry's imagination, and everyone who believes him, including Dumbledore, is crazy.Fudge is equally convinced that Dumbledore has started a secret army who are determined to overthrow Fudge and make Dumbledore Minister. So he sends his Senior Undersecretary, Dolores Umbridge (a truly DELIGHTFUL woman) to ""make sure things are running smoothly"" at Hogwarts.She makes sure that all the teachers are teaching correctly, but she herself doesn't really teach them anything. She doesn't let them use their wands at all. All the students hate her, and she hates them, but she hates Harry in particular. She slowly deprives him of all the happiness he has left in his life. Quidditch, letters to Sirius, and visting Hagrid. The only way Harry and his friends can fight back is to form a secret defense against the dark arts group right under her nose.Throughout the year, while Harry expects to recieve answers, he just gets more questions. Why is his relationship with Cho Chang not working out? Why won't these weird dreams go away?And then, one night, Harry has a terrifying dream. He tries to think of someone to tell, but Dumbledore is gone, McGonagall is gone. There is only one member of the Order left at Hogwarts. Severus Snape. But Snape does not listen to Harry, he just brushes him off. So Harry has to set out and fight a battle with his enemies, the Death Eaters, to find out the truth, about the dream and about his past, once and for all.If you haven't read this book yet, go out and buy it NOW!!!

Not only did Rowling manage to keep a constant engaging story line, but she also showed a greater depth to her writing styles and abilities. Of course, there was no doubt she is an amazing talent, HP5 manages to illuminate the British culture of the characters that seemed not to have been as prevalent previously. Stylistically, this novel is more complex, i.e., it is on a higher reading level than the previous instalments (this has no bearing on it's length or subject matters, merely it's complexity).It was notable to me that the tone of this novel was, as many have observed, much darker. There were so many times I kept waiting for Harry to have a good day, but his world is very dismal in his 5th year at Hogwarts, and there were few good memories. Not to say it is depressive; rather, it is stimulating and engaging.No matter the age of the reader, this novel is captivating (as well as appropriate) for most all readers, with the exception of those who are not willing to enter the magical world of 'Harry Potter'.",FALSE,2003,1472

In each novel, we learn more  about Harry Potter's parents (whom were murdered by Voldmeort, the greatest  Dark Wizard of modern times), as we and Harry come closer to finding out  why he escaped that night, as well as why Voldemort wanted to rid the world  of the Potters at all.Now, in the third book, Sirius Black, heir to  Voldemort, has escaped from the wizard prison--AZKABAN--and set out to  avenge his ruined master.

The sentences were simplistic (""Harry's new spell books were very interesting."" or ""Crabbe and Goyle looked extremely mean.""), the characters had personalities and delimmas that children could relate to, and the plots were very easy to understand without thinking twice. However, as Harry and his friends age and mature in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" so does J.K. Rowling as a writer.The third installment of the popular Harry Potter saga begins with our hero in his usual angry and oppressed state while living with the Dursleys, his only living family. He counts the days until he will return to his true home at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unlike the previous two summers, it is not wizards from Hogwarts who come to rescue Harry from his borderline abusive aunt and uncle, it is Harry himself who escapes after a terrible accident. In the middle of the Muggle world with only a small amount of wizard money (and NO ""normal"" British money, mind you) and unable to use magic due to a law preventing underage wizards from casting spells outside of wizarding school, Harry is STUCK. Meanwhile, the servant of the Dark Lord Voldemort and convicted murderer of a dozen Muggles as well as a wizard has escaped from the dreaded Azkaban prison and is rumored to be coming after none other than Harry Potter himself.""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is where Rowling began to really take off as a professional writer. Not only is the plot of the book more mature than before--the characters are, too. Characters, old and new, are developed unbelievably well and help push the ongoing storylines along without hesitation. The 435 page monster does not feel dragged out at any point; every chapter serves a purpose in the end (which will shock anyone who tends to expect the obvious.)  The 'dark' themes that exist throughout the book do not overshadow the lighter aspects Harry Potter fans have come to expect, fortunately. Quidditch plays an even bigger part in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" than it did in the first two episodes, the happenings in classes at Hogwarts are still given in detail (greater detail than before, I might add), Hagrid the Hogwarts groundskeeper still has an unusual soft spot for giant beasts that scare the pants off most people, Snape is as devilish as ever, and Harry's rivalry with bully Draco Malfoy is reflected throughout. The perfect mixture of 'light' and 'dark' is collected in this book; I cannot stress enough how perfectly Rowling pulled it off.In closing, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" abolishes the stereotype that Harry Potter is for kids while winning over ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""The Chamber of Secrets"" in every single category. Right here is where J.K. Rowling found her place in the world of magnificent writing.",FALSE,2005,2204

This is Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts; everyone is older, their personalities are more refined, and greater responsibilities are at hand. A lot of bad things are starting to happen in the world of magic. In essence, the fun - or most of it - is over. This book still made me laugh plenty of times; Rowling's humor will always be there. But this is a serious story and she has the ability to make it seem very real. I think anyone who is disappointed about this book not being as ""fun"" as previous ones has the wrong idea. Life was not exactly ""fun"" when I was an adolescent, and Rowling brings all of those fears, anxieties, uncertainties, and doubts to life. You may not be able to read Phoenix to a six year old, and THANK GOD for that, because it means that the characters, as well as the story itself, are growing up.

Some of the surrounding cast are also shown to be changing as well, which provides for an excellent read. The plot gets confusing in places, but really plays well as a mystery of sorts. Again, Rowling does an excellent job of extending our knowledge of the Hogwarts environment, along with an even deeper extension into the rest of the Magic world that Hogwarts is part of. In essence, her exploration of the world comes through the eyes of Harry, who (like the reader) has very little knowledge of the world around him. The ending to this one was also done at breakneck speed, but this time the outcome came in a little cliche fashion.

In my opinion the first two were pleasant little books but Chamber of Secrets was nearly a carbon-copy of the Philosopher's Stone and that took a little bit of the bloom off the rose. However, with the third entry in the series, Ms. Rowling tells a new story (not the same old 'oh-look-Voldemort-is-back type stuff) and really develops the characters for the first time. Harry, forced to deal with the reasons for his state in life, reacts as I imagine a real 13 year old would--angry and confused. Hermione is fleshed out and made to be a little deeper than the know-it-all she's been the whole series. Snape is a delicious villian and steals all the scenes he's in toward the end of the book.All in all, the best to date. I can't wait to read the next one.",FALSE,2002,1037

But the amazing thing about this series is it's attraction to the adult world, which is the standpoint from where this review comes from.It had been stated that the Potter series would get darker and more emotional, and J.K. Rowling has not let us down.  From finding out what Harry's Aunt and Uncle really think of Harry's mother, to Harry's coping with what happened at the end of the last book, Rowling again thrills with her mighty pen, making us not only read, but *feel*.  Even Dudley gets some much-needed sympathy here, but only so much, as it is still Dudley.For the sake of all reading this review who may not have read this book yet, I will omit a good many plot details, but there is much still to be said.  Alas, it is fifth year for the students, and that means O.W.L.s at the end of the year, and with it more homework.  This bogs Harry down (and Ron) as his... relationship with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher goes awry.  This gets remedied some, however, by Cho Chang, the girl whom Harry has a rather big crush on.  Ron and Hermione have big things happen to them this book as well; this occupies more of their time, and the reader is left without perhaps as much of them as they would like.This book is a behemoth at 800+ pages, though, so you will still get a good dose of them, as well as Malfoy and his gang.  Truth be told, almost every character in the book gets more time than in the other books, and this could work against the story.  J.K. Rowling does not let it, and makes even those minor characters have an impact (even Professor Grubbly-Plank).  It is noticeable at how Rowling, who has been a superb storyteller since the first book, as progressed in her writing skills; no word is wasted here (and thats a lot of words that could have been) and every action does have a reaction.There was no way possible to rate this book less than five stars, by merit of how many people it got more interested in reading alone.  However, since the book is extraordinarily written, drawing in the reader to a world unlike any other, and it keeps you reading until all hours of the night, plus the strong and deep characters, this book could deserve no less than the five I've given it.I was enthralled throughout.

But I feel one need not be unduly monogamous when it comes to loving books, and Harry Potter also finds a special place in my heart. One should not close one's mind when it comes to accepting (or rejecting) new things, that way one may miss out most of the good things this life has to offer.

Dumbledore is mostly absent, but is there to save the day. Voldemort-He Who Must Not Be Named-is growing more powerful than ever. Harry falls in love. The most hated nemesis in Harry's way is new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher Professor Umbridge, a woman who looks more like a toad than a human, who may or may not be working for Voldemort. Sirius Black, still on the run from the Ministry Of Magic, provides moral support for Harry, as do Hermione, Ron, George and Fred, (George and Fred also provide comic relief, as well as Peeves, the poltergeist) but it's mostly Hermione and Ron who stick by Harry. Won't say anymore about the plot, but it's the darkest novel yet in this exciting series and the end leaves you clamoring for books 5 and 6. Who wouldn't want to see Hermione and Harry get hitched? I know I would. The preceding IV books are very good, so I won't bother reviewing them seperately. Book I introduces Harry Potter and his world. Book II continues the saga with Harry and company (Hermione and Ron) battling a malevolent force that threatens everyone at Hogwarts. Book III reveals that a wizard responsible for a massacre and who may or may not be working for Voldemort has escaped from Azkaban, the dreaded wizard prison. Book IV uncovers that a nefarious prank at the Wizard World Cup may actually be a heinious scheme to lure Voldemort's followers back to him and sheds light on a member's mysterious past, ending with a shocking revelation. This book pushes the PG rating TO THE LIMIT, because it's more intense than its predecessors (look for that in the last two novels still to come in this intriguing saga of good vs. evil.)

It's the genuine frustration of a teenager.The depth that has been building in the last few books is readily apparent in this one. Especially now that it seems his worst experience ever is now something he can readily remember.I think that these first few chapters play to the quality of the entire book. I'm thoroughly enjoying the flip flop between the fun and serious interspersed with somewhat caustic jabs at the mundane.Some may not like this book due to it's exceptionally dark turn, similar to Goblet of Fire, it now is a matter of survival and thus it becomes much more serious than before. With Lord Voldemort making a stand, it is bound to become a much rougher ride than usual.Ms. Rowling's writing style is delightful and easy to read! The characters melt right off the page and the descriptions are vibrant and quirky to easily place you in a different world.Being a fan helps, so I know my review is biased, but I'm happy to see a more rich Harry in a more mature environment.

The established formula of the school year kicks off from the very start and brings us back to the familiar world of Hogwarts.  In this third adventure the stakes go much higher than they ever have before.Once again Harry, Ron and Hermione are faced with danger and mystery. Every encounter stretches their resources of courage, grace and kindness; when they overcome the challenges they always reflect and share their newly acquired wisdom and experiences.  I find myself cheering them on, and anxiously watching as they grow and mature into adults.  I find the blossoming romances, even at this very early stage, charming to observe.  :-)This is perhaps why in the third series I began to fully appreciate what a fantastic job Rowling has done in bringing the children to the age of 13.  The book itself has increased in maturity, depth and scope, almost as though the series is maturing with the children.In the Prisoner of Azkaban, we are introduced to the nightmarishdetails of the past wars between good and evil in a very real way. Those great events, whose consequences continue to echo through Harry's world, are presented in a real and palpable manner.  Again and again, the focus returns to his lost parents, and the great deeds and misdeeds that were committed then.Prior beasts and creatures only gave a hint at the horror and terror that the magical world contains.  Now Dementors are the ultimate manifestation of death and despair, and their introduction here pits Harry against his own great enemy, his internal fear and weaknesses. Facing these beings of darkness and horror forced Harry to reach heights of skill and courage he had only dreamed about before.The revelation of the identity of the Prisoner of Azkaban is awatershed event.  It brings forward to Harry the realization that his world will only get more challenging and foreboding, and it is encouraging to see him rise above his own fears and once again perform noble deeds befitting his name and honor.  His nemesis, whom he faced in the previous two books, now hovers in the background like a deathly fog, but does not appear to confront him just yet.  As fans we know such a meeting is inevitable.Rowling continues to amaze me with the flood of imaginative magical elements.  The world she creates becomes even richer and more wondrous in this third element.  From prisons where one's own soul diminishes and fades to the manipulation of time itself, she continues to enthrall.A very satisfying third installment, this book picks up a heady rush forward of the initial book and throws out ample rope for the next!

In short - Harry is growing up.I was a little leery of the size of the book (almost 900 pages), but the story flowed well, and there weren't any parts that I thought were superfluous - everything either advanced the plot or was an illustration of Harry's maturing.Two new characters were introduced - ""Loony"" Luna Lovegood (a student) and Dolores Umbridge (the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher).

In a distinctly adult battle of beaurocracy, Dumbledore's authority is eroded and the schoolis  being systematically stripped of freedom of thought and expression.The book is truthful to the experience of a 15 year old boy's lonely journey towards adulthood. Harry is changing. He experiences the akwardness and sweetness of a first attempt at romance. He is misunderstood and ostracized.I did not enjoy this book as much as book 4, but that does not mean it isn't a worthy read. You trade in your sense of wonder at the world of wizarding for a more pragmatic and mature look at human nature, wizard or not. Rowling asks more of the reader, just as she asks more of Harry.

"4480",5,731205,FALSE,"In response to some mild criticisms of the Order of the Phoenix, I think that the reader should understand this:  While Harry is growing, so is the story.  The story has taken higher grounds than ever before.  Before we saw Harry fighting basilisks, dragons, trolls, and all manner of monsters.  In the Order of the Phoenix, the battles have become personal.  Harry is fighting his own anger, his inner emotional battle with others.  Most of the conflict loops around the dreadful Professor Umbridge.  Sometimes the reader cringes with Harry's pain.  You end up feeling both sorry for and angry with Harry.  The conflict intensifies as the plot thickens.  Another sign of the maturation of the story is the growing good vs. evil theme.  We all know that Voldemort is evil and those on Dumbledore's side are good.  But the book also reveals how even good people make serious mistakes and sometimes seemingly evil people have a soft side to them.  We learn more about Sirius Black and James Potter and the conflict with Snape.  The reader may be left crying in the end.  It also becomes very exciting in the end with the Department of Mysteries, where the answer to many mysteries comes.My overall point is that what makes the Order of the Phoenix so good is that the story has really grown.  It's not a child's story.  It's a new awakening of life.  For that reason, I encourage people to read it.Another thing that fascinates me with this book is how the characters shine.  Hermione is so Hermione.  The Slytherins are all brats again.  Umbridge has no soft side to her.  She rudely interupts, she dresses and talks girlishly, she's racist, she loves seeing pain.  Then again, it goes to show how even people who aren't Death Eaters can be just as evil.  Harry has really grown in the end.I am a college student and I've seen the problem where other girls my age say that they don't want to read the book because it's so long.  Anyone in that age group should be aware that legnth doesn't matter; this is a very easy read.  I read this book in only two weeks and if it weren't for my college classes I would have read it even faster.  The main reason why I got into my college budget to buy it is that I was jealous of those who had finished reading within two days.

Hello?  Is this not what every character in the book has been telling Harry for the previous 4 novels?  How would acquiring this knowledge have helped Voldemort in any way?  Not that he needed to acquire it, since everyone already knew it.  (Likewise: Dumbledore's explanation for why he has kept Harry in the dark doesn't hold water.  Does Harry's study of Occlumency help him or not?  Since he appears to have no success with it, why did Dumbledore insist that it was vital he learn it?)  Finally, there are several scenes that just don't ring true in the book:  Black's death, and the entire romance with Cho, which, like much of the rest of the book (the writing on Harry's hand, the clothes Hermione leaves for the hous elves) is dropped without having made an impact by the end of the book.

I was so worried that I would find fluff and nonsense to fill the pages, but no---it was just as lovely as the rest.  To see how the characters are developing is so engaging.  Rowling does not shy away from the teenage angst that we have all felt on some level--she embraces it with her characters.  And to see those doubts and misgivings be justified or rectified is what makes the books so good!  To not be able to guess how it will all end, to actually stay up until 2am to finish the last half because you just couldn't put it down(I'm guilty of this), to feel empathy for the characters---all of these things are what makes this series wonderful.

Book 4 seemed to drag in the beginning and middle and this one had the same problem.  Subtlety is gone with her writing, which I understand to a certain extent, considering that children are a fair amount of her audience.

My old favorite characters were back (Sirius, the Weasleys, Lupin, Mad-Eye, etc.), along with a nerve-wrackingly hate-worthy new teacher.

Save the sorceror's stone, find out what the chamber of secrets holds, save Harry from Siruis, and the championship.  Well,  there wasn't any of that in here.

"4504",5,731575,FALSE,"Since there are thousands of reviews before mine, I'm not going to attempt to summarize the plot. I just wanted to add that the Order of Phoenix is definitely my favorite in the Harry Potter Series (and that is saying a whole lot).The story is somewhat dark, but it would be odd if it weren't. After all, we are talking about denial, corrupt politics, war, and (sadly) death. Harry is moody and often angry throughout the book. And why shouldn't he be? He had just seen a classmate die before his eyes, he had been left to worry during the summer with no sign of what he knew would be the most terrible event in over a decade, Umbridge and the Ministry have made his fifth year one pain after another, and he was not being taken seriously by the Ministry or most other wizards outside of the Order. I found it refreshing that Rowling captured what I think are typical and reasonable emotions of an adolescent in Harry's position. Harry is a realistic hero. He is mature for his age, but he still makes mistakes and is highly emotional. (Surprise, he's 15!) He is someone who we can relate to, rather than someone whose reactions are predictible and unattainable.But don't let the darkness get you down. There are many, many warm and funny moments to balance it off. Harry's friendships with Ron and Hermione become even closer and deeper, which I suspect will be invaluable to Harry in the future; the Weasley twins are funnier than ever (there were many moments when I laughed out loud); and just as Rowling answered many mysteries, she planted even more to keep us on our toes. In this book we are introduced to new characters and learn more about the ones we have already grown to love (and despise). And some of the interactions between the characters are absolutely hilarious (see, e.g., Prof. McGonigal and Umbridge).Overall, the book is brilliant. Despite its length, I could not put the book down. It was funny, moving, sad, fast-paced, and exciting. Now I can't stop wondering about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

"4506",5,731189,FALSE,"I've been a fan of the Harry Potter books since the summer of 1999, right before book 4 came out. I happened to buy the first book at a train station in New York and I couldn't put it down. After I finished it, I immediately ran out and bought the next two, and then waited anxiously for the fourth one. And now, 4 years later, book five has finally arrived.Clocking in at 870 pages, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series and arguably the most action-packed. My favorite is still book three, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but book five keeps the tradition going strong. It answers a lot of questions from the series, and leaves open a lot more questions that will hopefully be answered in the next two books. We get to see old characters reappear, we get to meet characters we've only heard about before, and we get a whole set of new characters, each written so well you can see them in your mind immediately. The book starts off in the time right after the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and as always, follows Harry and his friends through their school year. Harry is now 15, a bit older, a bit wiser and bit more headstrong and obstinate. Then again, aren't all 15 year olds? The best thing about this series is that unlike other series of books (for some reason the Hardy Boys books come to mind), the characters actually do grow up and change with age, instead of being the same, happy, simple people we met in the original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The book is faithful to the others by taking things that happened in the previous books and using them to help the characters learn and understand from their successes and their mistakes, and using that knowledge to help others (which is a major story line in this book).All in all, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is another amazing book in the series and well worth the price of admission. It took me close to 12 hours (with breaks) to read as I couldn't bear the thought of putting it down for too long. If you haven't read any of the books, well, what's wrong with you?

While i realize that's how most school years go, for the most part, it would be nice to get some variation to the pattern.

My wife and I read the book aloud together--we've done that with the previous books as well--so it took a while. We enjoyed it enormously, but here was my major thought: you couldn't pay me enough money to be a fifteen-year-old boy again. (No offense meant to all of you who are or soon will be fifteen--it's a wonderful age, but, as Harry exemplifies, a very challenging one.) The first three hundred pages positively drip with Harry's anger, bafflement, resentment, his sense of injustice... oh, and did I say anger? My wife, who teaches high school, nearly stopped reading with me around chapter 16 or 17--too much teen angst! Ms. Rowling is attempting something truly difficult as a writer--most novel series either freeze their children in time or have them jump, unseen, from one age to another--a la the Narnia series. To follow Harry--and his friends--closely through all their adolescent trials is both exhilerating and a bit painful! For me--and my wife--the book really clicked into gear once Harry and friends founded the DA. The rest of the book was the sort of rollercoaster ride we've come to expect, full of fun, surprise, and even a kiss, thank god.

The lack of drive that some of the reviewers above have complained of came for me not out of the final sprint to the conclusion at the end, but from the thoroughly bristly beginning. It made sense that Harry was ticked at absolutely everyone--but I could have done without 300 pages of it. Another thing--the death of a major character. I don't want to speculate too much, because if I'm wrong, what use have I served, and if I'm right, I've spoiled the next books, but let me ask this: the fourth book started with the death of a character we didn't know and ended with the death of a character we had come to like, but weren't that well acquainted with.

"4519",4,731496,FALSE,"I have read many of the reviews and find that the many readers who are avid Harry Potter fans have given the book 5 stars simply because it's Harry Potter.  Others have given it a less than stellar reviews because they think Harry is being to grumpy or they think it's too long.  I admit, when I first read the book I fell into the latter category.  Now I fall into a third category: those who have taken the time to re-read it, and reviewed it based on it's merit.  When I re-read OotP, I gained a whole new perspective on the book.  Firstly I would like to address the issue of Harry being too grumpy.  Guess what?  After all the trials and tribulations Harry has been through and then to be suddenly cut off from all information and treated as a helpless child, you would be a sourpuss too!  And let's not forget that Harry is only 15!  If he were to be the perfect little gentleman and rise above it all....well, that would be just plain unrealistic.  It's called teenage angst, people!  Others complain that there are too many useless sub-plots.  I disagree with this claim (with one exception).  The sub-plots give us a glimpse of Harry, Ron and Hermione's underlying personalities.  Hermione is obviously maturing much faster than the boys.  Harry is getting a chip on his shoulder where he believes the world's fate is resting.  And Ron has some serious self-doubts that have risen to the surface prominently in this book.  All the other sub-plots served a specific purpose to either tie things up in this particular story, or to further an on-going plot.  The only grip I would have is with Grawp, Hagrid's giant brother.  Unless he factors heavily in the next couple books, his sub-story was useless.  Sure, he shows up at the right time to distract the centaurs, but that could have been handled differently.  As for the length, can you say that after all the trials that the dreadful Delores Umbridge put the school-kids through, you werne't ecstatic when she received her come-upins?  Would you have been so delighted if it had only been a couple of chapters of torment?  Don't think so.  Personally, I began to hate her as much, if not more than Voldemort.  Guess it goes to show you that you don't have to be bad to be evil.  I thoroughly recommend this book, but read it twice.  Anticipation kills the appreciation the first time through.  I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not quite measure up with the previous ones.  Prisoner of Azkahban was by far the best with Goblet of Fire trailing close behind.  Philosopher's stone would be third best followed in succession by Order of the Pheonix and Chamber of Secrets.",FALSE,2004,1775

Each of the Weasley kids are developing their individual personalities more as well.I love the way Rowling keeps up with the times in her stories.  The characters are altogether ""today"", and altogether fantasy/medieval style wizards at the same time.  You find out that the heroes are real people.  Snape is not all bad, while James and Sirius are human too.  Even the Dursley's might have their good points. Meanwhile, the Ministry of magic is absolutely the bureaucracy of your choice.Well worth the wait, and a fantastic read.  Do remember to eat and sleep however.

Not only did Harry grow up, but J.K Rowling has written a much more 'grown up book' than before, to match Hary's growth. Don't worry, we still get a lot of the details about life at Hogwarts that made the previous books so charming. But we also see that the wizarding world isn't black and white: good people can come from good families, but people we thought were good might also have their wild side. That adults can make mistakes (even out of the best motives) and might not be able to reveal their reasons when you ask.

I started it as soon as it reached my fingertips; if I had waited any longer I think I would have had a meltdowm.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is by far the best book in the series so far. I think that they get better as Harry gets older.The book starts off cheerfully enough, as Harry gets attacked by some dementors with his cousin, Dudley, who can't see them so doesn't know what's going on. He uses magic against them and is called to a hearing at the Ministry of Magic. They do not believe, however, that he was attacked by dementors, because they don't think that the evil wizard, Voldemort, whom Harry witnessed come back from being barely alive, has come back. What happens at his hearing? Guess you've got to read it to find out.Before being taken to the hearing, Harry is brought to 12 Grimmould Place. The significance? See above.Harry goes back to his wizarding school, Hogwarts and is shunned by many of his friends because they don't believe that Voldemort is back. One of his teachers punishes Harry for telling everyone this in a very painful way.Harry trains many of his friends and a few of his friend's friends about defending themselves behind this teacher's back with a club called the D.A.Eventually, Harry must go to the Ministry of Magic with some of his closest friends to fight the dreaded Death Eaters and find something about his connection to Voldemort that could change his life.The fifth installment of the Harry Potter series is certainly the best so far and I am already reading the sixth one.

Yes, the usual cast of characters are there (Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron, etc.).  Yes, there are still mysteries to be solved and it all cumulates in a climatic battle of good vs. evil.However, what sets this book apart is Rowling's development of the characters, and her voyage into the psychology of anger, mistrust and betrayal.  That said, I imagine that this volume will not be a favorite with most children readers, or with people who are looking for the ""lightness"" of the early books.Although Harry's moodiness is at times overbearing, Rowling is being true to the character and to the fact that he is a 15 year old boy who is experiencing many different feelings.  First, he is dealing with his first love (Cho) and the complications resulting from the fact that he was with Cedric during the tragedy in The Goblet of Fire.  Second, he does not understand why Dumbledore is ignoring him, why no one will tell him what is going on, and why he is being secretly watched.  In addition, he returns to Hogwarts to the scrutiny of his classmates (who doubt his story about the return of Voldemort) and to the unrelenting scrutiny of the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher.Finally, Rowling is developing her characters past the two dimensional ""good"" or ""evil"" characters into more believable and sympathetic people.  For example, Harry learns some information about his father's past and he struggles to accept that his father was far from perfect.  Dumbledore admits to Harry that he made errors in judgment by not telling Harry key information earlier.I really enjoyed this book, but not for the same reasons that I enjoyed books 1 and 2.

It was a bit darker, but that is not a bad thing; Harry is a teenager, and teenagers tend to have dark moments. The book begins with Harry desperately trying to discover any word of Voldemort's return, and the Ministry of Magic denying everything; in fact they even hint that Harry is just trying to get attention. Without ruining anything for those who haven't read yet, this book has everything from dementor attacks and secret societies to the newest DoDA instructor. I read this book in 24 hours and will probably read it again soon.A note to those who feel the series is somehow evil: this is a children's story about good versus evil, and shows that it isn't always enough to just be good; sometimes you have to fight for what is good. Children love magic and also love to read about other children who try to solve problems without adult aid.

Harry, Ron and Hermonie  continue to grow - at 13 they have a lot more responsibilities and face more challenging threats.

Is it heresy to say I could have used some abridgement.  Plus, how many descriptions of Hermoine knitting clothes for house elves we really need?I also found it particularly tedius that it took over a whole CD after the climax for Dumbledor to explain to Harry what had transpired.One of the things that never really came across in the movies, but was apparent in this book is the portayal of magic as beauracracy i.e. the ministry of magic and all their departments and decrees (how British).

J.K. Rowling has outdone herself again with a tale that is funny, exciting, scary, and heartwrenchingly bittersweet. Fans of the series rejoice, we've not been let down (but seriously, was there any doubt?)Since the book has just been relased, I won't go into any specifics except to say that this is an amazingly well crafted story that picks up and takes you through an adventure like I never expected.

After using magic outside his magical school, Hogwarts, Harry flees from his aunt and uncle's house, thinking that the wizarding community will be after him.............This book was amazing! It is simply a classic! J.K Rowling has done it again, making this book with loads of fun, humor, and of course, magic! This book also has an attention grabbing plot to it, for you can read for hours without noticing it!This book is also the kind of book that you would want to read over and over again!  Reading it once just would not suit a real Harry Potter fan! Even after reading this book at least six times, I still have the urge to read it again!What really upset me though as that this book's movie (which came out in 2004) was nothing at all like the book.  After reading the book, I was expecting a very good movie, just like the book, but the movie was not at all as good as the book.  The book contains more details, and much more fun!

"4544",4,731606,FALSE,"First of all I must say that this is my favorite of the Harry Potter series. Being someone who reads such book as by the likes of Dickens, I didn't think I would enjoy the series very much. The series gets gradually better as each volume passes, which I hope will result in a phenominal ending to the series.I read the vast majority of this book in about a day or two. At first I wasn't interested, seeing as how the first few chapters are quite boring, which is aided by Rowling's simple writing style, but when the book picked up about a quarter of the way through it, I finished it within hours. It took me about a week to read the first quarter, due to uninterest in the plot, but once I got past that point, I enjoyed this installment of the series very much.I will not bore you with a whole plot summary, as I'm sure many people have already done, though I haven't bothered to look at the reviews, as to not taint my opinion of the book, but I will tell you that it is quite exciting.I have jotted down enough of my pointless meanderings now for you to understand my reasoning for liking the book. I only give this book 4 out of 5 stars because, though it is exciting and interesting enough, it is not very deep, which I must say is what attracts me to a book, though I only read this to see what all the fuss was about.Thank you for your time, and I hope you find that my review will help you make the decision to read this book (and to look beyond the accusations that people make of it being evil, which it certainly IS NOT!).",FALSE,2004,1885
"4545",5,731188,FALSE,"My high expectations were more than met by Phoenix, but this book represents even more nuanced and difficult explorations of the Harry Potter universe.  A major character dies, and Harry's anguish sets the stage for a closing chapter which sheds light on the overall themes of the series which have been hinted at throughout the other books.Death, sacrifice and loneliness are strong themes throughout the book, as Harry's interactions with Cho Chang are shadowed by Cedric Diggory's death in Goblet.  In addition, other series characters both new and old continue to expand our understanding of the universe, particularly with some interesting insights into Neville Longbottom and Sirius Black.However, the most surprising and powerful moment to me, having just completed the book, relates to Snape and Harry's father, in a flashback to their days at school.  Rowling's books seem to be almost unique in offering multi-facted complicated views of the putative heroes, and Harry's various angry outbursts are made even more meaningful with the discussion of James.  Harry's mother is also highlighted, and I hope that Rowling offers more of Lily Potter in the next 2 books.Parents be warned, however--Phoenix is a very dark book and younger readers (and read-tos) are likely to find much of the book disturbing and may have numerous questions about the death, disappointment and betrayals that Harry has to deal with.In summary, I loved this book, but I found myself crying for a significant part of the last 100 pages.

I forgot all about my chores... I'll confess here that I skipped ahead immediately to find out which major character died, was properly shocked, and started again from page one...but on to the book. I'm not summarizing it here, there's a great editorial summary already. This is just what I thought of it.It was gripping. From reading about Harry's apparently endless summer at the Dursleys', to his crossing swords with the Ministry of Magic, to his return to Hogwarts and everything he faces there, the book drew me in deeper and deeper, like a pensieve, so that I just stood around Hogwarts mesmerised, watching as Ron was made Keeper, as Hermione grows wiser, as the OWLs keep the fifth-years on their toes. There are some totally new and interesting characters. Luna is delicious, and Umbridge is just ANNOYING and EVIL, someone you love to hate.Ginny has really grown up in this book, and is shown to be a lively and great-hearted Weasley like the rest. I didn't like her much in the previous novels, but here, she seems to have gotten over her crush on Harry, and it's done her worlds of good. I thoroughly enjoyed her character. I was happy with how the 'love affairs' went in the book. It all went as I thought it should, though I felt Harry really was a complete duffer when it came to figuring out how girls think!Harry himself was more grown-up, more impatient, lost and confused in a world of grown-ups who keep telling him just enough to madden him. And on top of that, Dumbledore's ignoring him. Then there's Cho, who makes Harry's gut clench. I just couldn't understand why he kept losing his temper with the new Defense of the Darks Arts teacher when he knew what would happen in detention. All in all, there's a lot of headaches for Harry in this one, but our hero comes through sadder and wiser, yet again, cherishing his friends even a he returns to Privet Drive for the summer.I do wish that there had been more of Dumbledore...and I absolutely loved having a peek into Snape's memories...it was what I was hoping would happen. I know every Snape fan will analyze every memory thoroughly. Sirius, Snape and Moody all made satisfying appearances, and the things we find out about Harry's parents are quite surprising. The explanations for several things were also highly satisfying. When Dumbledore was explaining why he hadn't told Harry the truth in his first year, I felt rather disappointed in him. A few sentences later, I changed my opinion when I discovered that Dumbledore was rather more human than I had expected. It was touching.

Not only did this book take me longer to read, it was painfully slow.I'm starting to feel (having started the fourth book at work) that JK is very much stuck in a rut when it comes to the books. Each book takes place over a school year; it starts with Harry's birthday; and so far, it's the same every book. And each book is getting longer & longer. Honestly, how much can you cram into one school year?I'm starting to like Hermione's character more now, although she's still irritating. Just wait til you discover how she manages to do all her classes, I certainly couldn't figure it out properly, although I had an inkling - could I have one of those? I love the little romance that's developing over the books between her & Ron, although it seems very unlikely in my opinion! There's loads of clues pointing towards the fact that something no doubt will happen between them, although it looks like it's gonna be a gradual build up to something big hopefully. All the clues are there, you just need to look for them. I hope so anyway!I have mentioned in my past reviews, that as soon as I've finished one book, I've started the next book either straight away, or within a few hours. I've just realised, that although the books aren't gripping me, they must be somehow, but it may also be because I've got another 3 books to read, and it means I don't have to dig through my bookcase to find another book to read.I'm still eyeing up the DVDs, but doubtful I'll get them anytime soon. It will be interesting to see how the Quidditch matches transfer onto film, and other aspects of the books.What annoyed me about this one, was the finale. JK had too many ideas, and decided to throw them all in haphazardly, so they didn't make much sense, and there was too much happening at once. OK, the end of the book tied up all the loose ends, and there are a few revelations about Harry's past, but it was just too much at once for me to follow it and understand it at the same time.I still don't see why every reviewer I've seen gives these books five stars. I'm still reading them, but I don't think I should be giving them 5 stars - if they get better, they will. It seems everyone's brainwashed into thinking they should like them, even if they make no sense, so they give them 5 stars, even if it's only a 1 line review. (Why bother?)

Harry Potter contains many elements of a well-rounded novel, humor, mystery, and adventure!  J. K. Rowling did a fantastic job to even out all the characters.  Instead of Potter being in the spotlight of the entire book, major parts of the plot were given to Ron and Hermione.  All this adds to the twists and excitement of the story.

Now where some say that this book teaches to disrespect parents and the government, I think it does not. Harry has always had the highest respect in the Minestry of Magic and the Weasley's who were rather like his seregate family. I think it instead to teach people that you shouldn't always believe what you here (such as in the daily prophet ridiculing Harry's account of Voldermort's rising the june before). That and to fight what you know is the right thing to do. In Harry and Dumbledore's case, it was to try to warn the wizarding world of Voldermort's return to try to protect everyone. I think it also shows that sometimes we also have to accept that those who are good make bad mistakes, such as Cornelius Fudge, but that if you can help them to see the truth, you can work together to rectify those mistakes.

Hogwarts isn't quite the haven for Harry that it had been up to this point, even in comparison to his difficulties in The Chamber of Secrets.  The world becomes darker, flaws in the heroes are exposed, and another tragic death occurs.  Yet despite this, or perhaps because of it, the story is still captivating.  As Rowling has said, when writing about good and evil, the choice always exists between dressing evil in a black hat and calling it evil, or actually showing evil for what it is.  Rowling has taken the latter approach and I commend her for it--most villains in stories often read by children are mere charicatures.  Voldemort and his Death Eaters are not; they have chosen power over morality, personal gain over innocent lives.  And their actions show it.  Meanwhile, those that resist are not infalliable.  Personal grievances still divide some of the members, and people don't always realize what all of the consequences of their own actions will be.  And some people, even in positions of authority, are short-sighted and fearful.  In other words, they're people, with a full range of strengths and weaknesses.  Rowling continues with her masterful work, part of a world that's detailed and internally consistent--from its starting assumptions, the world is realistic.

It's probably the best among all as the author spent more time developing the characters in the book, esp. Harry Potter and Sirius Black. For someone of my age, more than 25 years old, a pure fantasy book can't hold my attention for a long time. I consider this as a breakthrough for the author.  4 star b'cos I didn't like the ending, the fact that Sirius Black died and the other people didn't seem much affected by it except Harry Potter and Dumbledore.  It seems the author spent so much time developing the character and at the end, just cast it aside without explaining much, maybe, she is planning his return?!

Black was believed to be Voldemort's right-hand-man, and when Harry Potter defeated him, Black's downfall was assured.  Harry and his friends have returned to Hogwarts for their third year of school, and are met with Dementors, the guards at Azkaban.  Until Black is caught, the Dementors will patrol the grounds, and that is a problem for Harry because they exert a special power upon him that makes him pass out.

Rowlings latest title in the Harry Potter series is the best yet.As usual the book starts with Harry spending time at the Dursleys a long way from his friends (and enemies) at Hogwarts. But something is different this time. First of all Harry has grown a year older (he is now fifteen) and there's a lot people trying to make him look untrustworthy in the public. This is especially done by writings in the paper Daily Prophet.The reason for this campaign against Harry is that the ministry of Magic simply denies that the dark Lord Voldemort has returned.When the minister of Magic at the same time is paranoid and has got the idea that Prof. Dumbledore is conspiring against him in order to seige power in the ministry doesn't improve things for Harry.When Harry arrives at Hogwarts the ministry has sent a representative (Prof. Dolores Umbridge) who is really messing things up at school by interfering in every little tiny thing that happens at Hogwarts. At the same time she is appointed to take care of the classes in Defence against Dark Arts and even manages to be High Inquisitor of Hogwarts.Its the fifth year at Hogwarts for Harry, Ron and Hermoine and they have to take OWL examns in a lot of topics so they are all busy. At the same time Harry experiences the difficulties of the first love when he's trying to figure out the relationship with Cho.The young wizrd is going through a lot of trouble and he is obviously confused about getting older but also about the relationship between himself and the dark lord.The novel is all the way building up to the great final where Harry once again has to stand face to face with Voldemort only this time he has to pay a higher price for the encounter than he had in the previous encounters as he actually loses one of his loved ones.All in all a great novel and I cannot price it enough.",FALSE,2003,1482

J.K. never ceases to amaze me.What is it about?:Voldemort is back to power and he once again tries to defeat Harry Potter.  Harry and his friends go back to Hogwartz but things aren't the same.

"4599",5,731858,FALSE,"In 6th grade, I was given an assignment in which i had to pick any book that was at least 150 pages and appropriate and write a book report on it. I chose some dumb star wars book.. i cant even remember what it was called. At around the same time, my mom happened to get me a book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. I read the first chapter of that book and I was hooked. I COULD NOT STOP READING IT! I changed my book report to Harry Potter the next day. I thoroughly enjoyed that book and i followed the series religously(including the movies) until after the chamber of secrets movie was released at which point I thought I was beginning to grow out of the series(I think i was in 9th grade at the time). I abandoned the series for nearly 3 years. However, not even a month ago, out of sheer desire for nostalgia, I snuck into my brother late on a night when i couldnt sleep and stole his copy of Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix. I didn't sleep at all that night. I read the first page of the book and my love for the Harry Potter series was rekindled. Granted, this may be mainly due to the fact that the series is taking a more mature direction with this book. You will see what I mean when you read it. I won't be surprised if the movie for it gets a PG-13 slapped on it for all the violence.

It simply does not happen. As I have grown, so has the series and while i thought I was too cool for HP for a couple years, I have now realized how immature I was being. Simply put, If you grew up with this series, don't abandon it because you think you are getting too old for it. These books are only getting better, keep on reading them!!!P.S.

"4604",2,731184,FALSE,"It was a week ago today that I finished reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix; it has taken that long for me to organize my thoughts and decide on a review. Throughout that time I have alternated between praising the style of Rawling's writing and denouncing her pitiful plot structure. But one thing has bothered me behind it all, and after a week of reflection I know what it is...Above and beyond the fantastical storytelling and breathtaking adventure the Harry Potter books offer, we must remember that they are in fact children's books (though I would argue that this last volume is not suitable for ANYONE under the age of 13). Children's books, while they entertain and broaden the vocabulary and skill of young readers, also teach lessons and display examples of human behavior that children then learn to emulate or disregard. Children learn through the struggles and triumphs of others how to deal with difficulties and challenges in their own lives. And here, then, is the problem: I would not want children taking ANY lessons away from this book.The first disturbing element of the book is the distant and almost negletory maner in which Harry is treated by his so called allies and friends. He is kept in the dark, pushed along, and is treated neither like a child (who is cared for) nor an adult (who is respected) but as a non-entity who must simply exist until his turn in the game comes up. He goes to Hogwarts and must deal with the wary stares and accusations of a population who has been told he is a loon, and those few people who believe him (with the exception of Hermione and Ron, his only true allies throughout this story) tell him to sit down, shut up and behave himself. If things had been explained to Harry in the beginning (rather than on page 825, after all the trouble has occured), he might have obeyed without so many conflicting emotions. Readers wonder why Harry spent the book whining and brooding - wouldn't you? He is pushed from scene to scene, restriced from asking questions about a situation at which he is the very center.Because of this neglect I feel the greatest ""miss-lesson"" in this novel is taught - namely, how to deal with a lunatic like Professor Umbridge. She is painted in this novel as someone worse even than Voldemort - an adult who is filled with only malice and evil, but is permitted to hurt those around her (ESPECIALLY the children, ESPECIALLY Harry) because there is no one who can and will stop her. When Harry is subjected to her cruel and painful idea of detention, having the words ""I must not tell lies"" gouged into the back of his hand repeatedly for over a week, what does he do? What can he do? He has, in effect, told the truth, the most profound and important truth that Voldemort has returned, but because of political and social ramifications which have not been explained to him, he is being punished cruelly, I would go so far as to say abused. And he tells no one, because he feels he must be a man and deal with this on his own. The absence and preoccupation of his elder allies (especially Dumbledore, the biggest idiot of them all) causes him to ACCEPT THIS ABUSE IN SILENCE, rather than expose the horrid treatment he should not be enduring... I don't think I have to explain any further why this is a lesson our children should NOT be learning...It is with definite regret that I say these things about Rawlings' latest work, having been a great fan of her first three novels, and the lessons of love, strength, truimph and endurance she taught therein. But this book is not only different, it is painful and misleading for children, and what they take away from the reading experience is a million times more important that what an adult ever would.",FALSE,2003,1463

While Harry must stay on his guard at all times, Sirius Black is just one of his many concerns.  This book is very suspenseful and action-packed, and is a thrill to read.  It will keep you guessing until the end!Although some may think that the Harry Potter series is for children, I believe that it is for anyone.  Its continual action and mystery make it exciting to read and easy to get caught up in, while its complex series of events and unrevealed secrets keep you guessing.

"4610",5,731181,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has, beyond the shadow of a doubt, lived up to the hype.  This book, although different in many ways from the others, compliments the series perfectly.  Rowling alludes to events in each of the previous four books more than in any other book.  She brings back characters that most readers never expected to see again-people from Sir Cadogan to Professor Lockhart.  Although most of these characters are only mentioned in passing, some, such as Professor Trelawney, play much more important roles. Either way, it's nice to know they haven't been forgotten.Faithful fans of Harry Potter have learned that Rowling never puts in a detail without a reason and 'Order of the Phoenix' confirms this.  Details from the first four books that you never expected to amount to anything become important factors in 'Order of the Phoenix.'As everyone notices, this book is indeed darker than the first four.  A few readers have complained about Harry's attitude in this book.  He is unarguably more bitter and angry.  I find this change in Harry makes the series even more realistic.  He has suffered abuse at the hands of the Dursley's, witnessed death, fought Lord Voldemort numerous times, and has been through more than most 'normal teenagers' and even adults have in their entire lives.  His new attitude can hardly be blamed.Other characters show more depth as well.  We find that Dumbledore is not perfect, Ron does have some potential, Snape has his reasons for his bitterness towards Harry, and James Potter and Sirius have their darker sides as well.  Humour abounds in the story particularly through the antics of Fred and George Weasley.  The reader will also be surprised and pleased to see how Ginny begins to take after her brothers more in this installment.In 'Order of the Phoenix' we also get to see more of the wizarding world beyond Hogwarts.  Harry journeys to the Ministry of Magic as well as St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.  The depth, creativity, and complexity of this book manage to make Harry's story more believable and fascinating than any of the previous books have done.

A wonderful series of evil happenings occur so just when you think Harry's world can't get any worse it does.On the negative side, though this really has nothing to do with the story itself, is the writing. Rowling has resorted to the tactic used by mediocre and lazy writers (which she certainly is not since the book is 870 pages) of putting Harry's emotional outbursts (of which there are many) in caps, rather than showing us by the way he acts what he is really going through. It seems a small thing, but Harry has become a teenager and pages and pages of his shouting and capitalized lines eventually get boring.  I found myself skipping large sections of this kind of dialog.The end of the story is wonderfully done and a great prelude to what's to come.

As soon as a new character begins to speak, it is easy to tell exactly who it is.  The pacing is comfortable to listen to and the volume never rises to an uncomfortable level.  A very well done rendition of the book.  I leave it in my CD player in my car for when I take my daughters on any trip longer than 15-20 minutes, and they absolutely love it.

This book was perhaps less frightening than the fourth. The climax was a bit confusing, with so much going on, but still exhilirating, very--emotional. We see all the heroes making mistakes, Harry's being, in my opinion, among the greatest of them, though Dumbledore decideds to take the blame for it. A lot of interesting things happen at Hogwarts, both enjoyable and infuriating to Harry and the reader (from my point of veiw, of course:) ). Gohstdom's reasons are revealed, as well as Voldemort's reason's for trying to kill Harry (haha, he chose as he chose; Harry and--well, someone else--their lives and their roles could have been SO different!). There's some excellent character developement, especially involving Ginny Weasley. I could, however, have used some more, a lot more, in other areas, areas (*cough, cough*) that may be impossible to build upon in the future (*cough, cough*). (((Please don't think that's Umbridge's cough! That's just one of those, ""pay attention, I shouldn't say more but here's a clue"" coughs!)))  Well, I guess that's all I can say. Overall, this book starts trying to get more in depth, exploring, as the synopsis says...

"4629",4,731195,FALSE,"To make this review short but sweet:1.)  Harry's character development seemed a little abrupt from book 4 to 5 and yet it makes sense that he would grow tired and angry at his situation.2.)  Umbridge was a great character, very easy to hate.  I can't understand all the reviewers who seem to only want happy characters and uplifting storylines.  Life is more true in this book than the others.3.)  The climax of the story wasn't set up well enough to have the impact that the previous books had.  It happened too suddenly and left you wondering if there was something that you missed when you finished the book.  This is the reason that the book only gets 4 stars.4.)  Dumbledore and Harry's relationship becomes more interesting in this book.5.)  I am glad that Cho and Harry didn't take the expected path in book 5.6.)  Dumbledore's explanation to Harry didn't have much in it to awe me.  It mostly stated things we already knew and the new stuff wasn't ""magical"" enough to be interesting.7.)

"4631",5,731210,FALSE,"Although I enjoyed books 1 through 4, this is definitely the best of the series so far.  In addition to excellent plotting and scene-setting, Rowling has added to her characters' humanity by making Harry somewhat unlikable -- a typical 15-year-old boy, as everyone knows! -- and all the more human and believable for his foibles and personality quirks.  Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and some newly-developed characters at Hogwarts whom we've met earlier all add to the sense of familiarity and fun, and the added intrigue of the Order of the Phoenix and goings-on at the Ministry of Magic make for a page-turner.

He determines the innocence of a wronged party and finds the  perpetrator- again, but in a very compelling way.  Hermoine's solution to  her vast ambition was very nice- very creative on the part of her teachers.  I especially enjoyed her overworked, overtired reaction to the Divination  teacher- I suspect mine would be similar.  Harry also solves a mystery that  appeared in the first book- I wondered what the purpose of Ron's rat was,  and now we know.  It makes me wonder what other mysteries lurk in the first  three that will be solved in the next four.  And oh, how long do we have to  wait until the next one comes out!",FALSE,1999,86

They are ready to die for the cause, and sadly it is what has to happen, as we say goodbye to a person who was ready to meet that head on.  I recommend that this book be read as a family if you have younger kids around the ages of 7-10, the book has alot of anger as harry has to cope with the world, and cope with the stress of sometimes being left out of the loop of whats going on for his own protection. also with the darker tone, and some literary moments that can send shivers down your spine, i recommend that it is a family read.

It seemed a lot darker than the other books- Harry seemed like some disturbed teenage maniac and was furious for the entire duration of the book; I don't think that any teenager could be that furious.This book is just so dark... and not in the dramatic way.

I made sure that i read it twice before I wrote a review, that being said, I would like to state my basic opinion of this book. JK rowling becomes more and more sophisticated with every novel. Her writting is more and more complex and grows, just as her characters are. This series began as a good childrens book, for 7 or 8 year olds. I believe the book now is for teenagers and adults. The audience has grown with her writting. In this book Harry is very angry, and irrational. Some may see him as being dumb, but I see him as being a teenager. That said the following is SPOILERS! do not read if you have not finished the book!!!!!!Harry is very grown up in this book, seeing someone die (cedric in book 4) has really changed him. He seems more revengful, and he snaps at Hermione and Ron alot. Not only that but he is maturing as a man.I don't really see a future for him and Cho, though at the end of the book, I think that Ron was hinting towards Ginny and Harry as a couple. One of my favorite parts of this book, was when Fred and George left, it was hilarious, and very well written. They will be important now, i think that their joke shope will do very well, and that they will own it until they die lol. Also we now know that Harry or Voldermort must die. I do not want Voldermort to die, just so it's a happy kid's ending. I think that JK is seriously considering killing Harry, and she is the author so I trust her.",FALSE,2003,1461

This book is truly excellent.  It shows the world not in shades of black and white, but gray.  No one is perfect, and bad things happen to good people.  The writing is full of texture and multiple layers of meaning.  It means a lot ot me as an adult, and I would have loved to read these books as a child.  I think they teach valuable lessons.  But specifically, this book is outstanding, achieving the transition to adolescence with the ease and grace that our poor protagonists won't have again until the teen years run their course.  I can't recommend this book highly enough, its worth even penny, and the three year wait.",FALSE,2003,1469
"4642",5,730461,FALSE,"The third in the series of Harry Potter books, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, by J. K. Rowling builds delightfully on the promise of the first two and sets the scene nicely for the fourth adventure.  The usual themes of whimsical invention and things not being what they appear are carried over but now there is a deepening sense of terror, such as added by the quite frightful Dementors, with a richer emotional tapestry as the lives of Harry Potter's deceased parents is explored.  The series only grows richer with each volume but without losing any of the initial charm that made it a hit in the first place.

As usual he has to spend his summer with his irritating and dispicing Uncle dursley and moreover what makes his summer worst is that he was isolated from the wizards world with no friends and no news of anything about Voldemort coming back. He finally gets to Sirius's, his godfather, parents house, which was used or the order of the phoenix.Then, his days at hogwart starts. As a teenager, Harry starts facing more complicated cases. There is a sudden surprise that Professor Umbridge of the Minister replaces as their Defence against the Dark teacher and she starts to bring radical change in the school, changing everything and every rule in the school. Even banishing Fred, George and Harry from the quidditch team.Not being allowed to use magic or learn proper Defence Against the Dark, Hermione comes up to an idea to form an organisation called Dumbeldore Army and Harry would be their teacher. DA was an illegal organization but Harry was taking every risk to run the DA. Harry is in his OWL ( Ordinary Wizarding Level ) year and he gets pile of homeworks, which makes him difficult to put up with everything. Nobody in the Ministry beleived that Voldemort would be back.

Upon reading this book, I fell in love with all the characters. It makes me wish that I went to a school like that when I was young. I bought some copies for my nieces and nephews. They really enjoyed them. One of my nephews actually received extra credit in class for bringing his to school. I also suffer from depression and this book provides stress free reading which lets me explore my new found imagination. As a Christian I don't have a problem with it either. After all it's just fantasy.

"4649",5,731200,FALSE,"Okay...we've waited forever and after reading book 5, I've got to admit it was well worth the wait.  I was worried a bit, concerned that maybe Ms. Rowling would not be able to continue the magic that she had conjured up in the first four books.  My worries were put to rest upon starting chapter one.  I am continually amazed at this author's creativity---her imagination is incredible, lucky for all of her fans.  In ""Phoenix"", she shows us a teenage Harry, moody and testy with his friends, going through a great deal of anxiety like most kids his age.  He, however, has much more to worry about than the average kid....namely Lord Voldemorte.  There are lots of new things happenings---a new Defense of Dark Arts teacher, lots of politics at the Ministry of Magic, a love interest---enough to keep any Harry Potter fan happy.  Rowling is allowing the readers to grow up with Harry and experience his gradual maturing into young adulthood.  My only regret is that I'm finished with this book and now have to wait for book 6.  This is an incredible read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading----I couldn't put it down!",FALSE,2003,1479

I do admit that the beginning is a bit slow, and I was a bit put off by Harry being so angry and moody. But in the end I think it all just really sucked me into the book even more and made the character more intriguing. If Harry had remained the boy wonder of the first two books, by now his character would have become boring. There are faults but Rowling does so much good that it seems irrelevant to nitpick at what she does wrong. I loved the book, and for me it is definitely right up there with the Goblet of Fire and the Prisoner of Azbakan as the best books of the series. I highly recommend it.",FALSE,2003,1501
"4651",2,731197,FALSE,"The latest installment in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix proves that if you've already sold 5 million copies of the book, what difference does it make what you write?The first three books of the series were indicative of classic literature.  All the requirements were there:  a struggle between good and evil; the power of love vs power for its own sake.  The plot was concise; the narrative compelling.  Descriptive details will forever leave the image of the Great Hall with its hundreds of floating candles and enchanted ceiling in our minds.We were forgiving in the fourth book.  A rushed deadline and a lack of tight editing turned book 4 (Goblet of Fire) into an overly long hodge-podge.  The decent into ""pop"" fiction had begun.  We have the International Quidditch Cup, where we are given a parallel to the modern soccer match turned slug-fest.  Too much time is wasted getting from the first page to the last.Which brings us to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  Rather than a return to the classic feel of the first three books, Rowling's Phoenix only carries us further down the road of ""popular"" reading.  If I wanted to read a book about an angry young teen, I could have picked up any one of the novels that my 15 year old likes to read.  Angry boy from a tough background, misunderstood by his peers, disrespectful of authority, achieves redemption through strength of character.  Sound familiar?  While this might sell to the younger crowd, I think it loses it appeal across the generations and across time.In addition to the irritation of Harry constantly being nanoseconds away from his next angry outburst and just about everyone speaking with a snarl, I was highly disappointed with the language of this book.  I imagine that in fifty years it will be nearly impossible to decipher all the slang that Rowling has chosen to use.  One phrase not difficult to decipher is Uncle Vernon's:  ""Enough...effing...owls!!""  At first, one's eyes slide over the word ""effing.""  Perhaps it's one of those British words we don't understand.  But it becomes clear, as you think about it, that it's a substitute for that favorite four-letter f-word.  Yes, it's even what my own teens use when they don't want to get in trouble for ""the real thing.""  I can just imagine a class of 3rd graders being read to by their teacher.  Johnnie's hand goes up.  ""Mrs. Johnson, what does `effing' mean?""  What's the answer to that question?I noticed that the American version did much less ""translating"" than it has in the past.  Sneakers are referred to as trainers and sweaters as jumpers, as they are in the British version.  Maybe it's time we learned UK-speak.  I was immensely relieved, however, that the editors did change something that one of the Weasley twins said about the O.W.L.s (fifth year wizarding tests).  In the British version, we find out that during exams it's hard to ""keep your pecker up.""  Don't worry, in the American version, it's your ""spirits"" that are hard to keep up. But be warned in case you like to order the British version as a compliment.  Why would this phrase be used at all in a book such as this?  You might argue that it's the way teen boys talk.  I argue that it will keep the book from becoming a classic.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is little more than an exploration into the psyche of J.K. Rowling, the author.  It's no surprise to me that her mother died suddenly when she was young given the sudden and arbitrary way she killed off the designated character in this book.  And now that she has more money than the queen, she can dangle us all like puppets on her ""need to control"" string.  Complete secrecy regarding the plot, with only a few phrases released in advance.  Book reviewers were not allowed advanced copies.  Translators had to wait like the rest of us, delaying the release of foreign language versions until December.  Publishers of an early review are being sued for million of dollars for revealing plot details prior to the publication date.  Seems a bit silly now, doesn't it?Perhaps if the book had had a believable plot, more of the rest could be overlooked.  At the end of this book, the characters have simply aged one year.  There was no growth, no enlightenment.  The willingness of Rowling (a teacher by profession) to include a teacher who inflicts a punishment which draws the blood of a student turns my stomach. We are told things by Dumbledore that we didn't know previously (but could very easily have guessed), but his exposition only leaves us with more questions. Death, we learn, is arbitrary and sudden.  I picked that up in the last book, with Cedric Diggory.  Why couldn't the death in this book be sacrificial or serve some greater good.  Rowling's cryptic answers of ""Wait and see how it all plays out"" no longer suffice for me.  I'm cutting the strings.It's really too bad that this series suffers from too much of Rowling working out her own issues.  In the end, this book will be remembered by time for the record-breaking sales and not for its literary value.",FALSE,2003,1476

One of my more disgruntled friends put it eloquently ""Just split it into two chapters: Harry is angry and Dumbledore is weird""Although I agree that many repetitive parts about Harry's teenage angst could have been slashed, I still feel that this did not spoil the book simply because of Rowling's skill. Her smoothly flowing storylines and a steady supply of wisecracks (the Weasly twins) are what prop this story up and prevent it from becoming a tedious bore. In fact, I found fault with the Harry Potter movies because the script cut so much of the humour that is inseperably part of the books' lure.The best part of the book in my opinion is that it finally reveals the secrets that have we have been pining for since Book 1.

I think the book dragged a little too much and it took a little bit for me to get into it, as compared to the other 4 books where I was instantly hooked. Another thing that irritated me was Harry's attitude. I know he's 15 now and at that age where he's angry and stuff, but I think Ms. Rowling went a little overboard in places.Other than that the book was great. All of the old characters returned, and some new ones added. There seems to be a lot more action in this book, and it's much darker.

K. Rowling's masterpiece of a series.After ""The Goblet of Fire,"" J. K. Rowling's series took on a darker tone, which is continued in the fifth installment of her now classic series.  This book, entitled ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is the longest and most complex of all the Harry Potter books, which marks the beginning of the new war; the war of good and evil, Harry against Voldemort, the Order of the Phoenix and the DA against the Death Eaters...  And, this book also finally answers the question we've been asking since Book One:  Why did Voldemort try to kill Harry in the first place?This could be considered the most IMPORTANT book in the series, because as ""Goblet"" was a turning point (Voldemort's resurrection), ""Phoenix"" is an obvious turning point for the entire series (the prophecy is revealed).The most impressive thing about this book is that despite it's length, every detail of the plot comes together in the end, and it's all beautifully woven into the story--ANYTHING that happens in Harry Potter happens for a reason.  While the story does drag slightly in certain places, it often picks up right away (and when you least expect it), launching you into a Hogwarts adventure.Another great thing about this book is that it shows how different each entry of Harry Potter is.  The characters mature, Harry's angst is real, Snape's actions are believable in correlation to his past, Voldemort is frightening, Dumbledore is witty, and Umbridge is repulsive.  While the characters embark on very different adventures, you grow to know and love them; especially a new character, Luna Lovegood.The death in the story is surprising, tear-jerking, and very real; Harry's reaction to it is almost heartbreaking, and J. K. handled it perfectly.  No other writer could have written a climax as suspenseful as that which Rowling has in the climax of this book, which has Harry and his friends (young and old) facing Voldemort and his Death Eaters at the Ministry of Magic.While this book it often criticized by people who say Harry's angst and anger is over done, I dare them to put themselves in Harry's shoes and say they wouldn't react the same.

The Ministry of Magic is taking over at Hogwarts. Harry's mind is being entered by Voldemort. And he has a girlfriend.J.K.R. has created a memorable book, paced slightly different than the last four, with a darker and more urgent tone. Voldemort is uprising and a major character dies. The book is different but good and really gets the story arc of a second war, started at the end of Goblet of Fire, moving. You don't want to miss this one.",FALSE,2003,1470
"4659",5,731189,FALSE,"The criticism has been leveled at J.K. Rowling that her portrayals lack depth and realism. She paints with a vivid brush, say the critics, but one which leaves holes in people and situations already fraught with the difficulties of making fantasy real. The crises that face her heroes get resolved far too cheaply. The classes are simply plot movers. The world isn't real.These complaints can now be officially forgotten as Rowling's latest offering presents a truly real cast, complete with problems, issues, spite, anger, and very few cheap theatrics, in a way that none of the previous books have. Gone is the quick-fix attitude of Sorceror's Stone; gone the one-dimensional character interactions of Chamber of Secrets. We now have a world where Harry can love Sirius, and yet be disillusioned about the cavalier way he and his three companions behaved while at school. Now Harry can still despise the Dursleys -- and yet risk his own life to safe Dudley. Now we can know that Petunia Dursley does indeed have compunction about the well-being of her nephew. The relationships we now see are less easy to classify, because they are becoming more adult in nature: more nuanced, more opaque, more confusing to those who have them. The world isn't black and white and primary colors anymore.Rowling has always shown an incredible command of the power of the literary art to reach young readers. But in Order of the Phoenix, she moves on to a new level of writing: the judgment of historical -- in this case, current -- events, under the guise of a fantastic story. Rowling asked for an extension on her book contract shortly after September 11th, and it is now clear that she rewrote the book to include a message that it is not right for a government to abandon its law and principles for its convenience in emergency. Cornelius Fudge as recently as Christmas of Harry's fourth year had been a politician more skilled in the breach than in the observance. But as events move swiftly toward a terrible crisis, he becomes a personally weak but paranoid autocrat who is willing to bring down all the institutions that his socieity functions upon so as to maintain what he feels to be the status quo. And his terrible sidekick, Professor Umbridge, opens the book as the power behind the scenes, manipulating events and people for ends even she does not fully understand, but soon becomes the worst nightmare of those whom she governs. These people, and others in the story, may not have exact parallels in the real world; but the implication is clear for the one who would see it, that even in a magical world, the lust for power need not be limited to those with a skull tatooed onto their forearm.I could close this review with the usual phrases in praise of the book -- ""I couldn't put it down"", ""An Absolute Must"", even ""Book of the Year!"" -- and none of them would be untrue. But I feel that this book, more than any soundbite quote can encapsulate, besides capturing the imaginations of an entire generation, has a genuine role to play in the education of young people as thinkers of great thoughts.

But this book continues that pattern: it is actually MORE enjoyable than either of the first two books, and I would not have thought that possible. Rowling continues to have a marvellous touch with everything that makes a book enjoyable: characterization, dialogue, plot, pacing, background detail, description. Given that there are over 2000 reviews of this book here, and it has a rating of five stars (or close enough to it to be visually indistinguishable from it) as an average, I'm sure I'm not saying anything here that hasn't been said already, but I'll add my voice to the chorus: don't miss this book or this series.

Still coping with the death of Cedric, Harry does indeed lose yet another someone, this time someone he is very close to. Somewhat disappointingly, JK does not give us the kind of surprise-twist ending that has marked the other books of the series up until now.

The action is fast-paced, and there are not many dull moments in this year of Harry's life--and there are some that make him rethink his view of Hogwarts as his personal Utopia. He deals with things that aren't nice, aren't fair, and that don't seem to have solutions...in other words, the real world.As a mother, I'd be wary of allowing a young child to read this one alone; parents need to read it, too, in case there are some personal issues for their child that they should be ready to discuss--including the death of someone close.",FALSE,2003,1471

However, I am more than a little disappointed in Rowling. I hope that before she releases Books 6 and 7, she takes the time to learn how to write properly. Don't get me wrong, she has an amazing imagination and she knows how to bring a reader into the story and feel as if they are there. But if you compare the actual text to classics from the past, you will notice her lack of sophistication.I don't believe she is doing this for her younger readers' sake. She has no problems putting in 10 point vocabulary words that many 10-15 year olds would not understand. Maybe the editors that she has are a little nervous about criticizing her, thinking that she's already making billions of dollars, why risk it??? By taking the time to edit the book properly, the readers will get much more out of it.Heading into Book 6, Harry will be turning 16. With Harry's reading level increasing, Rowling's should as well. I hope that she will take the time to cut out the unnecessary adverbs scattered in every other sentence and stop repeating everything that was written in the previous books. I think that the readers have a good understand of the story and don't need it reiterated in every book.Back to the story - I cant say enough good things.

Readers will feel the same fondness for the colorful and interesting characters in the book. There's the gifted Professor Dumbledore, the smarty-pants Hermione Granger and, of course, Harry Potter.Book 5's weakness lies in the beginning of the story. Having been cooped up in Privet Drive all summer, Harry Potter becomes very angry to the point of open hostility. This outburst of anger is reminiscent of Star Wars Attack of the Clones, where Anakin Skywalker is like a volcano waiting to erupt. The next few chapters will leave readers feeling tired of Harry's incessant hostility to every one he meets. I guess, that's just the typical teenage angst.The middle of the book will finally comfort the readers, as the other characters finally make their appearance. The succeeding events will make the readers anticipate, excited, sad, angry, etc. JK Rowling provides twists and turns that will engage the readers in a rollercoaster ride of emotions.Overall, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix lives up to the hype. It is suspenseful, riveting and readers will stay glued to their seats, waiting on the pivotal twist of who's going to die in the end.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a must-read for Harry Potter fanatics (like me).

Well maybe but there is more to writing then denouement and enveloping structure (not that this book has either.  this book just isn't as fun as the others. It doesn't read like a kid's book.

Grammy-Winning Narrarator Jim Dale has a different voice for each character (how does he keep them all straight) and brings the book to life, more so than even the movie could do. Owning all five sets of the audio edition, I can say I have gotten my monies worth out of them all.

A few warnings though; First, if you have never picked up a Harry Potter book in the past, do not start with this one.  J.K. Rowling does very little backtracking on storylines in this, the fifth Harry Potter book in the series,  so you really need to know the characters already.  Another thing to know is that, unlike the first three books, (or four, depending on your own personal opinion), this is not a childrens' book.  The book's overtones are darker and more sinister, the characters are all older and no longer enchanted by Hogwarts, as they have been in the past.  For the Harry Potter fan, this book answers many of the questions you may have had since The Sorcerer's Stone, like why Voldemort tried to kill Harry when he was only an infant and why Harry's aunt and uncle take him back every summer, when they dislike him so, just to recall a few.  Other interesting points in this book: learning more about the Ministry of Magic and St.Murgo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.  The main premise of the book is that Dumbledore and the ""Order"" are trying to convince Fudge and the Ministry the Voldemort has returned.  Not only does the Ministry not believe them, it turns against them, as it attempts to discredit many of the Order's members, all the while slowly taking Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry out of Dumbledore's control ...

Gnostic gospels, anyone? Also, aren't we a little beyond being concerned about what is or is not appropriate for people to read? If your child has read the others and can get through this one, then it is quite likely that she/he is a discerning individual who is bright and mature enough to handle what comes their way in this kind of literature. Your child vigorously reading this book should engender more excitement on your part than anything else -but then constrictive moralists are as rampant as they ever were. I like how some of the parents horde these books for themselves while condemning the childrens' reading. It is fitting of Rowling's more nefarious characters in the books. Funny.Rowling displays a unique elegance in the struggle between forces of good and evil in a style that is true to her tradition but that also reflects a willingness to venture into more experimental territory like the characters in this book (who deftly explore some familiar and not too familiar realms of fantasy and magic).I, too, was expecting a few more surprises and revelations to justify the incredible hype, but she did a satisfactory job nevertheless.For what it is, it ain't too bad.",FALSE,2003,1469

It is definitely darker than the other 4, but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. Harry is getting older and more mature, so his experiences have to reflect that.  Why some people don't get that I'll never know.  Anyways, JK Rowling only gets more talented with each book.

Every once and a while it seems Harry's about to step out of his self-pity and return to himself but then he drops into it again.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the book and it did advance quite a few characters, I just didn't enjoy it as much as the others.  I know it's a dark time but this installment just didn't seem to have ANY of the lightness or joy on the part of the characters that the others did- something I felt made them more interesting and appealing when the going got rough in previous books.

And though I understand why Harry is so emotionally stretched as a teenager, he annoyed me.But that doesn't mean that the book was not an entertaining read. There were many aspects of the book that were excellent. I think JK Rowling did an absolutely amazing job portraying what it feels like to be a teenager. It is a roller coaster ride - sometimes you are happy or sad, sometimes both, sometimes your emotions switch from one to the other in a split second, sometimes you get angry for no reason at all. All of this is within Harry this year, and given everything he has gone through up to this book, it is no wonder he struggles with so much. Although I was annoyed, it is realistic for a person of this age. And it speaks volumes about Rowling's skill in portraying a teenager so well that the behavior can even annoy a reader. I especially enjoyed following the antics of the Weasley twins, learning more about Neville, following the progression of Harry's crush, etc...Other than the death of a major character and the events leading to the verification of Voldemort's re-appearance to the wizarding world, this was a story which had less action and focuses more upon character development. We don't really learn much more about Harry's story than what we already know from the previous novels. But we do know more about existing characters, and are introduced to a few new ones which will likely play roles in the future.Overall, I really enjoyed the book.

Hormonal bursts of anger (this is a disgusting understatement, by the way), sexual attraction, and immense distrust plague our hero left and right. Not to mention the death...

Harry and his cronies have developed into teens,rude at times,interested in the opposite sex,taking responsibility for their own learning,emotional, etc.  There were several sub-plots that were perhaps unnecessary (the giants and centaurs), but maybe those are leading up to something?

On top of that we see Harry have interests in female characters in the book.  Which makes for an uneasy life-style for Harry because he must deal with school, girls, Voldermort, and a newly founded group called ""the Order of the Phoenix"".  In which,  Harry's Godfather is a part of.

In the end, Harry goes after the prophesy only to find its a trap and sees someone dear to him die before his very eyes.  By the end, the war between good(Harry) and evil(voldermort) intensifies only to leave us hanging on the tip of an edge in which we must find our footing in the next book.

Although the start can be slow, it's hard to set down once you get into it.I don't know what makes the world love these books so much.  Perhaps they bring out the kid in adults.  Perhaps because they are exciting.  Or perhaps because as many of us read Rowling's book, we begin to treat the characters as living people, not as figments of her imagination.

"4705",3,731191,FALSE,"This is a book full of entertaining moments, but in the end it left me a bit disappointed.  After five installments, I fear that the books are getting a bit stale.  The pattern is now too familiar, and the newness and 'magic' have started to wear off.The first book excelled because it brilliantly executed the classic-not-cliched device of a poor, put-upon wretch of a boy who manages to triumph over unbeatable odds by the final chapter.  Unfortunately, Rowling has stuck with that script too religiously.  It's becoming increasingly difficult, with each new book, to accept that Harry is a poor, put-upon wretch at the beginning.  Sending Harry back to the Dursleys for more abuse (and seriously, wouldn't they be terrified of him by now), is no longer as entertaining as it was.Also, I'm starting to find that the ordeals Harry endures are becoming a bit TOO oppressive.  I find myself thinking of Hogwarts as equally horrible as number 4 Privet Drive.  A return to Hogwarts virtually guarantees that Harry will be treated horribly by teachers and (some of) his classmates.  What's more, Harry seems to wait an interminably long time before he does anything about it.  For example, in this installment, despite prolonged and horrifying sadistic physical punishment by a teacher, Harry never complains to anyone who might have done anything.  Instead, the Boy Who Survived merely suffers in near silence, enduring his punishment as if he were unchanged from the defenseless victim we met at the beginning of Book 1.  It's immensely frustrating.One other thing that may have affected my enjoyment of the book was the pre-release hype.  I had read several articles about the book in the mainstream press, including interviews with the author on CNN.com and elsewhere.  In those articles, Rowling gave hints about huge plot events and secrets to be revealed.  After finishing the book, I have to wonder what great secret she thinks her audience didn't already know.  As for the huge plot event she alluded to, it was much less significant than the hype would have indicated.This book isn't horrible.  I still devoured the thing in less than 24 hours.

The themes seem to grow in maturity along with the characters, and although still perfectly suitable for young readers, seems to carry a more adult appeal than the previous 4 volumes.Well worth the price, you will be sucked into this vortex of fantasy, and find yourself sharing the adventures of our favorite young wizard.

Maybe it's time they came to realize that many of us see THEIR opinions to be nonsensical and dangerous. Considerably more so than Harry Potter !J.K.Rowling has the proven ability to LIFT the human spirit, as evidenced by the huge worldwide demand for her books. The religious fundamentalists who decry her writing do not have that ability to inspire and motivate - only to denounce, decry and control. Ask any young reader what they are thinking when they've finished a Harry Potter book. I guarantee that 999 out of 1000 will not even think to mention the word religion. They'll tell you that Harry and pals are their heroes. That they are the good guys fighting AGAINST evil. And all the evidence it the book points that way.If, as some reviewers claim, the Harry Potter character represents evil, then ask who is he fighting? Are we to understand that his arch enemy, The Dark Lord Voldemort, is the GOOD guy? Come on - get real! The only reason you're slamming this series of books (and, clearly, the author) is because she doesn't appear to share YOUR views of God, Jesus, Allah, Yahew or whatever. Nothing like a bit of religious tolerance, is there? Little wonder that most of the destructive wars in history were fought on religious grounds.Presumably, if you follow the logic of these particular reviewers, we must also condemn Tokien, Dahl and many others who have written children's books. They, too, have invented other worlds and characters who don't have to have a god ruling their every action.

She was excentric, and mystical, but she remained true to her convictions. The continuing development of Neville Longbottom was well crafted, as was the new Divinination's instructor. We can see from the novel, Neville will come into his own someday.The Order of the Phoenix demonstrated Harry relying on the best talents of friends that chose to accompany him regardless of what they may face.  However, in this text, each of the seven were acting as a team.  Each of them demonstrating bravery and loyalty well beyond the expectations of the book's hero.The adults in the novel also have been well-developed.  The students now in their fifth year have a very good understanding of each of their professors.  They may not all have a positve relationship, but it is as should be.

I hated to see this change in Harry, but having been 16 once myself, I remember what it feels like to have the world against you (and literally for Harry!).  We see few changes in Ron and Hermione, but perhaps that is because the story is told though Harry's eyes.

She's funny, she's dramatic, she's inventive, and she's just an all-around good storyteller.Having said that, I'm not sure The Order of the Phoenix is the best book she has written so far.  I'd give that honor to The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had a series of killer plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat.

His Aunt and Unlce dont like him listening to the news so every time they figure out his secret to listening he has to think of another one. The letteres he gets from all his friends and Sirius are not very helpful because they are not allowed to say anything important incase the owl gets into the wrong hands.

For every detention Harry got he had to do something that none of the teachers at Hogwarts would be very happy about(sorry dont want to spoil it).Also, its their 5th year and they have to study for O.W.L.s.

The second time through you try to find the hints, references, and clues to understand the wizarding world, which is definitely not an egalitarian society.

Also, practically ever character that appeared in the previous novels returns in this one. Everyone from Lockhart to MacNair, the Death Eater/Executioner.  This is a much darker book as well. Voldemort returns, many Death Eaters do damage and things are just more violent here. Torture and killings and curses that make you cringe as you read only heighten the thrill of reading this book.

The story is darker, scarier, more intricate and more intense than any of the others.  It is a bit long and, perhaps, could have been shorter.

Still, there are two other books to be written and those parts, if Rowling it true to form, will play roles, may be even significant roles, in those books.The saga continues.

He is having the oh so very irritating out bursts of anger due to the always very helpful hormones of a teenager. To make a long scene short, Harry ends up almost getting kicked out of school for using magic over the summer, again. He then meets up with Sirius, Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Wealsey, all their children (except Percy) (and might I say Ginny has matured alot!), Lupin, Moody, hermione, and a bunch of others that I can't remember at this second.

"4741",3,731535,FALSE,"This book is fast-paced enough to keep a reader's attention, but it really isn't a very good book. I'm going to focus on two reasons. First, the plot isn't very believable. Voldemort just wouldn't have put so much time and energy into getting the particular ""weapon"" he was after, and the adults in Harry's life who cared about him would have warned him what Voldemort wanted him to do. And the adults who are on the right side, and in power, wouldn't have gone so far in allowing things to deteriorate at Hogwarts. Also, Harry is able to see animals he never saw before, because a person must have seen someone die in order to see these beasts-and yet from the very first book one has been told that Harry's parents died in front of him. Didn't that count?Second, the author seems to assume that her readers are at a more ""sophisticated"" age, and she panders to that, mostly in showing every single adult in the book to be a failure. The whole series has had the weakness of its young heroes casually disobeying and getting away with it-even finding that their disobedience is what allowed them to win a game or defeat an enemy. But in this book, the disrespect aimed at parents is shocking. Adult heroes talk to and about their own parents using abusive language (granted, some of these parents are pretty awful, but one just doesn't talk to parents that way, and it's also not good that the author consistently shows parents as being so bad that they ""invite"" disrespect). Ron is forbidden by his mother to join a school group, and the reader knows Ron isn't even going to bother considering her command-he joins without thinking about her command even for a minute. And even the ""good guys"" among the adults fail. The young people are left to rely totally on their own wits, because the bad adults in this book are usually stronger than the good adults, and the good adults make some foolish mistakes. Even when the young people's ""wits"" fail them, it turns out in the end to be because adults made poor choices and failed to give them information they needed. Well, fortunately most of today's teens aren't as ""anti-adult"" as the author thinks they are, but any attempt to show kids that adults are all dumb or cruel is a GRAVE disservice to kids. It's also a disservice to suggest that constant anger and actual disillusionment with the adult world are a normal part of growing up.Parents, if your kids read this book, please discuss it with them. Kids who can read this book are old enough to know adults aren't perfect, but nobody should tell them that children and teens need to make all their own decisions because they're smarter than adults, and no one should tell them that most parents are neglectful or cruel, and nobody should tell them that disobedience and disrespect is a more intelligent choice than obedience and respect. Kids who defy or ignore authority don't, in the real world, end up saving the day for the good guys; they end up in jail, unemployed, or even dead. Also, of course, kids need to know that in the real world, entries into REAL magic are dangerous, and witches and the occult world aren't innocent fun.",FALSE,2004,1814

After hearing the ridiculous amount of controversy surrounding these works, I was prepared for shoddy writing and nefarious, subversive pseud-literature. Obviously, I found neither.""Order of the Phoenix"" is indeed darker than its predecessors. This book isn't intended for five year olds, and I see no reason why good children's literature full of suspense, magic and a bit of thrill shouldn't be available. Thank goodness J.K. Rowling seems to agree. The regular cast of lovable characters are back, in the midst of pubescent angst, and dealing with an evil sorceror to boot. Harry's life is never dull.At 800 plus pages, this is one of the more involved children's books around, though the reading isn't difficult for young adults. I definitely would not recommend this book, or any in the series, to very young children as there are more advanced themes that many parents may not feel to be suitable. Obviously, informed parents would want to read the book first anyway.Harry, Ron, Hermione, Cho...all of them are growing up. The fact that their characters develop a broader emotional range is indicative of this fact. I certainly remember myself at 15.

In Harry's case, these extremes could very well be accurate, which is one of the reasons these books hold so much more magic than any wand from Olivander's could summon.J.K.

He's nasty to his friends and, while he sometimes has cause, always seems to think the worst of just about everyone at first.

"4765",4,731199,FALSE,"I enjoyed this book like the others.  I once read that in making movies, every scene should advance the plot.  What I like about this books is that as elements are introduced, some of which seem unrelated or unimportant to the plot, they are always re-introduced into the plot later.  This is true even with material from earlier books, and so, for instance, one of the teachers who seems worthless and pointless in the earlier books, ends up having a huge role in the history of Harry's life and an important reason for being at Hogwarts.  It's been sad that this is this generations Star Wars.  I (and I'm 38) think it's better then Star Wars, because it has a consistant quality throughout the books that the Star Wars movies lost after the 2nd movie.  On the negative side, people have said that Harry was angry in these books and didn't like it.  I felt differently.  What I didnn't like though was that he did seem increadibly irresponsible.  A major character made a huge sacrafice for Harry in the middle or this book in order to get Harry to do something.  Harry didn't do it and it resulted in the death of another character.  Although there were some explanations for this, I found it hard to respect Harry for being so irresponsible.  Towards the end, Dumbledor (don't know the spelling as I get the audio tapes!) takes responsibility for this, but I think Harry is mainly responsible and it influenced my enjoyment of the book and my respect for Harry.  To continue the Star Wars comparision, this book is somewhat like Empire Strikes back in that way, with the main character not keeping his responsibilities and faultering.

I would have been very put off if he was written as the same wide-eyed, compliant kid as he was in the first book. In order for him to grow up in the next two books it was probably necessary to write him as impatient and stubborn in this one to show how far he's come. At least, that's my take on it.Also, his relationship with Cho, I liked the fact that Cho was a crybaby and whiney and wasn't what Harry had expected. First crushes rarely work out. Life throws curves like that at times.The scenes where they are awkward with each other and racking their brains to find something to say, had me giggling. Probably in the next two books he'll find someone who's direct, honest and doesn't play games.There's more scope and more dimensions to the characters. It can't be expected that they remain the same after all that's happened to them so far.So don't be put off by the dark tones in this volume.

All the major themes that Rowling has explored in the other books in the series are reiterated here: the meaning of ""Family"", the power of Love, of memory, and of  loss, and the continuing influence of those people that have made us who we are as human beings, even if those people (i.e. Harry's parents, and presumably the major character who tragically dies in this novel) are no longer physically present. Rowling also has begun to explain, and flesh out some of the more intriguing characters in the series such as Snape, who is interesting enough to be the star of his own novel I think, and James Potter who Harry comes to see was all too human. We begin to get the sense of Harry growing into a man in this book, and Rowling shows a healthy respect for the nascent intellect of young people that is so often overlooked or dismissed by adults (to tragic consequence here.)

This year Harry learns about the cruel way his parents died, a lot more about Voldemart, who Sirius Black truly was, and the person who is hiding at Hogwarts.This was really an exciting book to read and the ending is very inventive so people would probably never have guessed it. Hopefully Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire can match the intensity and fun in this book that makes you not want to put it down!",FALSE,2001,748
"4788",4,730392,FALSE,"The third book in the famous Harry Potter series. While it is difficult to have a successful book, it is much more difficult have successful book series. If the writer has done something too different, then the loyal fans would not like it. On the other hand, coming up with something too similar then the sequel will be formulaic and boring. Because the structures of the first two Harry Potter books are almost identical (start off at the Dursleys, preparation for school year, going to Hogwart, some mysterious things happen, Harry and folks try to solve the mysteries, bad guy show up with a surprise revelation), it would be unwise for J.K. Rowling to follow this path too closely again. So, in this sequel, it is revealed at the beginning on what to be expected but the catch is -when- and -how-? The pacing of the book is great in the first half but after that, the main plot seems to fade away until the end. Despite the nice settings in the first few chapters, there aren't many things related to the main plot happen until late in the book. The surprise twist did not surprise me anymore when it was revealed, however, because so many clues were repeated again and again more than necessary (unlike the first two books that the twists really surprise me). On the plus side, I think this book does a better job than the previous one in portraying multidimensional characters. The new characters (Sirius, Lupin) are interesting. The only exception is Snape, which in my opinion is the most interesting character in the first book. Here he's reduced to just a plain, simple jealous guy without any other emotions. To summarize, I think it is a good, fun, must-read for the fan of the series but J.K. Rowling has to up the ante in her next book for the series to be a real timeless classic.",FALSE,2001,671
"4790",5,731195,FALSE,"It's been a long three years since Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Thankfully, it was well worth the wait. Rowling delivers an amazing, engrossing novel simultaneously full of humor and tragedy. It's been said many times that Goblet of Fire was dark. Order of the Phoenix is darker. Yet, at the same time, it is a profoundly human novel. After finishing, I sat down and thought about what it was that made these books so wonderful for me. I adore Tolkien's works, from The Hobbit to the Silmarillion. They are epic and intricate. The end of Return of the King touched me in a way few novels have. Yet, in the end, it is a story of wide scope, told from the point of view of a few key adventurers. The Harry Potter books exude a quality which Rowling describes in the wrenching scene in Dumbledore's office near the novel's conclusion -- heart. I have read no other series in which the characters can attain such grandeur yet maintain the flaws which denote their humanity. This was not always true for the early part of the series (I'll discuss this later), but it seems that as Harry ages, the books' content and depth increase as well.Rowling certainly uses many literary archetypes, and the death of a main character is certainly no plot innovation. Yet the book remains gripping throughout. No book in my recent memory has made me so anxious, or made me loathe a villain so thoroughly. Dolores Umbridge, the personification of power-hungry, narrow-minded, iron fist government representative, fostered a sense of enmity I rarely experience with novels, much less day to day life. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of those books that makes you want to hurl it across the room in rage at the injustice perpetrated by Harry's opposition (for most of the novel, the magical government and/or its delegates).It's hard to explain the rest of what made me enjoy this novel so thoroughly without spoiling anything. The best I can do is say that character development abounds. The picture-perfect, white and black view of adults and heroes often present in the earlier books is dispelled (no pun intended) forever. Harry's beliefs regarding his parents, his enemies (Snape, in particular), and Dumbledore himself are shaken. Dumbledore's talk with Harry after the final confrontation touched me deeply. We finally see Albus Dumbledore, the man. We see Harry mature greatly. This is Harry Potter's coming of age story - he's no longer the innocent, naive boy who saves the world (this perception was fading even in Prisoner of Azkaban, but the transition is truly cemented in book five), and there are certain realities that he and the reader must face as a result.Similarly, Order of the Phoenix marks the transition from children's fiction which entertains adults as well (remember those deoderant commericals? Strong enough for a man, pH balanced for a woman!) to a deep, complex storyline containing characters children know and love. I'm not sure how much the kids who got into The Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets will enjoy this - perhaps the presence of the beloved characters will carry it through (not to mention the antics of Fred and George, the ever-hilarious Weasley twins). However, Order of the Phoenix is packed with content for late teens and adults alike. From Harry's trouble with girls (and the resulting change in his views towards Cho following the tragedy) to the obvious satire on newspaper, government intervention, and censorship, there's something for everyone.It's just a wonderful book. Give it a try, although I'd recommend at least reading book 3 and 4 first if you haven't. For a long time I neglected the series, thinking it was kids' fantasy, not worth my time. I was sorely mistaken. I feel the bromide applies here - Don't judge a book by it's cover.",FALSE,2003,1474
"4792",4,731198,FALSE,"WHY YOU'LL LIKE THIS BOOK: ""Phoenix"" maintains the high standard of rich, detailed storytelling we've come to expect from Rowling.  She continues to keep Harry's world fresh.  There are many tantalizing new things revealed that we've never seen before (Harry's ""guardian angels,"" Sirius Black's family, elements of Professor Snape's past, Neville Longbottom's parents, O.W.L. exams, and whatever happened to Gilderoy Lockhart, to name a few).  Similarly, there are a number of interesting developments with the existing components of the past (Ron's new pursuits, Harry finds love -- or does he?, the trouble with Percy Weasley, the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher you love to hate, and Fred & George Strike Back!).  For these reasons alone, ""Phoenix"" is an absorbing and interesting read.  If you don't expect a completely happy, sappy ending, you should love every page.WHY YOU WON'T LIKE THIS BOOK: Book 5 of the Harry Potter series is a definite departure from its predecessors.  ""Phoenix"" does not follow in the footsteps of the relatively light-hearted adventures of Harry's past 4 years at Hogwarts.  Rowling portrays Harry (in a rather over-embellished fashion) as a moody and conflicted teenager given to fairly regular outbursts of frustration and general angst.  Anyone expecting Harry to be sweet and perfect (or at least unchanged/unscarred from his experiences) is in for a bit of a shock.  Harry exhibits the typical (and often stubborn) behavior of many real-life teenagers.  The bulk of this book also deals with the Hogwarts crowd enduring seemingly incessant (and extremely frustrating) meddling from the Ministry of Magic.  The comeuppance comes, eventually, but it is hardly satisfying.  Finally, prior installments culminated with excellent (and often unforeseen) twist endings.  Not so with ""Phoenix.""  The ending, while not predictable, is rife with action and excitement, but little else.  Think of this more as an excellent ""filler"" episode in the Potter saga, as opposed to a stand-alone giant as some of the previous books have been.One last note on Harry's behavior: Several reviewers have noted (and complained) that Harry, in Book 5, is ""mean,"" ""rude,"" and ""insensitive.""  They're not wrong, but that hardly describes the entire character.  Indeed Harry is all these things at points, like anyone, but not at all times as some folks make it sound.  In keeping with the direction events took at the end of Book 4, the story follows Harry trying to come to terms with horrors he experienced in Book 4 (having seen a fellow student murdered in cold blood before his eyes and narrowly avoiding being murdered himself by a resurrected Lord Voldemort) and deal with the frustration of being ""out of the loop"" from the wizarding world over summer.  If you imagine yourself being treated like a child when you've already had to shoulder the burden of an adult, throw in seeing a relatively close associate die in front of your eyes for no reason, as well as being recently confronted by the person who murdered your family, you then begin to see where Harry's outbursts come from (IMHO).",FALSE,2003,1477
"4794",5,730134,FALSE,"The second I closed book two in this series which I loved even more than the first one, I opened this one. Will Mrs. Rowling again be able to make this book as fresh as the first two? Yes and no. The freshness definitely wears off a little bit in this volume, but just as I decided to award this book only four stars, I reached the finale, which was even more breath-taking, exciting, imgainative and deeply gratifying than in the first two installments of this wonderful series, so I concluded that this book is also worthy of five stars. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean that everything before the finale is boring and dull, far from it, Mrs. Rowling still finds new variations for all the now familiar plot elements and comes up with an astounding number of new and wonderful ideas and surprises - including a godfather for Harry! The world she created gets more and more detailed and complex so that it may fly over the heads  of very small children (and might be, in some scenes (the dementors) too frightening for them), but it makes it all the more enjoyable for adults and children over 10 to whom I highly recommend it. Take my word for it: This novel is far more complex than your average No.1 bestseller, no small feat for a book aimed at and advertised for children! After closing this book, I immediately picked up book four, so check my review there if you're interested if it is as good as this one.",FALSE,2000,413
"4797",5,731188,FALSE,"Since you have all probably read the editor's review, I will not bore you with all the details of the book. Reading this book I had such a range of emotions that I can not begin to put them all down in this 1,000 word review. What I can say is that, I have been, like many others, eagerly awaiting this book to come out. I have posted notes on web sites saying how I thought the story was going to turn out; who I thought was going to die and so on. I was not disappointed at all, however I must say I was surprised. We were all so wrong in all the rooms. What an incredible achievement it is to have a book come out like this and still be able to keep the audience guessing, and even surprise us. I can not tell you how many times reading this book how tempted I was to skip ahead  to find out what was going to happen next. . A lot of what I just read was unpleasant and sad; this is definately the darkest  chapter in the series so far. It is not as scary as some of the other books, but the importance of the actions of the wizards and of the and the events that take place are more important and have relevance on a much larger scale, Harry is not just fighting to stay alive this time. I will not give away any spoilers, it was fun to speculate, but it really will ruin the ""experience"" if you try to get the information about the plot points before hand. The death that happens in this book was unexpected and very sad, it really must have been hard to write, but it is not the turning point of the book. The book as a whole is very detailed, well plotted, and full of ""real life"" emotions. Even though this world is a magical world, a fictional world, the lessons learned in this book have a relevance that touches on all aspects of human exhistance. The characters are in fact mirrors of every hope, dream, emotion that we have all felt. No one said the path to greatness is easy, and as we all will read, Harry's path is not an easy one, nor is it meant to be, but the things we  have romanticizd in our heads about what it means to be a hero:fame, popularity, greatness, bravery,  respect, are all put to rest. What is means and what it is are two different things.  The defination of what exactly it means to walk the path of a hero is what is described here. Rowling's imagionation, skillful writing, and the ability to suck us into this world, is a rare gift. Im glad that she's using it. Think of how many orther geniuses imagionation's are being sparked right now reading this book,  may of whom may grow up to write their own works. That is an achievement that no amount of money or rewards can replace. Five platinum stars for this wonderful book!",FALSE,2003,1467
"4800",4,731193,FALSE,"Honestly? Book V was rather draining. I wish I hadn't heard of Rowling's anguished move of eliminating a major character. As I read, I became fearful for each character who got in the least bit of trouble. I was relieved when a character survived an attack. Then the gloom returned as I wondered who, in fact, it would be.Book V witnesses the introduction of several new characters. There wasn't enough time, I suppose, to develop their personalities to the degree that Harry's and Ron's and Hermione's were. I believe the power of the Potter series is in the reader's ability to feel what the characters are going through, to appreciate their dilemmas through their eyes. I'd hear one of the new characters' names mentioned and I'd have to think twice to remember who he/she was. But I could tell you in an instant anything said by or about Hagrid, or Arthur and Molley Weasley, for example.Book V is the first of the Potter books that I actually began reading. I heard the first four only on audio tapes. (So please forgive me if I spell some things wrong!) But I quit reading before long. To me it was like watching a movie with no sound! The audio books are wonderful!!! The characters are given discernable personalities! After a while I found that I'd rather listen to Book I or II or III or IV over again rather than go on to something new. I was that caught up, and am still trying to understand ""why""!I do hope that all readers of the Potter series -- the children especially -- will take note of what happens when they do not truly ""listen!"" to one another, when they assume they have it all figured out when, in fact, they are clueless.I was disappointed to see heretofore favorite characters do things so out of character for them even as adolescents, or to realize after too many lives were altered that they should have spoken the truth or gone to those who could have shed light on matters sooner. For example, around Christmas, Harry was given a very valuable means of making contact with someone important to him. But he dismissed it without even checking it out because he feared it would not do what the giver said it would. Nor would Harry do what key adults in the Order of the Phoenix begged him to do regarding one lesson in particular. Also, I could have put a muzzle on Harry more than once.I didn't like how Book V ended. I know, I know; can't be all roses. But I loved the previous year-end feasts' descriptions, and heretofore I've been able to enjoy how loose ends are tied together the way they were at the end of Book III when Harry got an owl from Serius while on the train going back home. That note explained about the Firebolt, etc. I especially wondered what Percy Weasley thought and felt in Book V, now that he would be seeing things differently.I suppose I'll also have to wait until Book VI or VII to understand what Rowling was leading up to when she mentioned in Book I that Hermoine clutched ""the stitch in her chest."" In Book II, Ron came racing into Snape's office where he was interrogating Harry and clutched a ""stitch in his side."" Harry also clutched a ""stitch in his side"" coming out of the water during the second task in Book IV. Wonder what it means!I do trust where Rowling is going with her story. I applaud the fact that she spent so much time on her outline. Seeing the end, she is able to spin quite an enriching tale leading up to her conclusion. Based on what Professor Migonnagle (spelling!) said to Harry when she discussed his future aspirations, I became hopeful that perhaps the series will not end when (and if) Harry finishes his 7th year at Hogwarts.Rowling is some creator! If one woman can captivate the world with her imagination, characters she has brought to life with her pen, imagine how much more of a Creator God Almighty is, Who blows the breath of life into each one of us and follows our individual stories with rapt attention!",FALSE,2003,1472
"4802",3,731187,FALSE,"NOTE: I would have given it 2 1/2 stars, but we all know Amazon won't allow fractions. Contains mild spoilers.First, I'm as big an HP fan as anyone else, but this big has such significant problems, it's *almost* irrideemable. We'll do the bad first:1.  THE PLOT: There's barely any plot AT ALL. Plus the little bit of plot there is doesn't present itself until p.500 some! Yes, I'm completely serious, p.500 some.2.  THE PROPHECY: At the end, Dumbledore tells Harry the supposed reason why Voldemort tried to kill him. It's a prophecy. The problem with this prophecy is that it doesn't tell us anything new! WE ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT! WE WAIT 800 SOME PAGES (not to mention 4 other books) TO HEAR A ""REVALATION"" THAT'LL SHAKE THE FOUNDATION OF THESE BOOKS TREMENDOUSLY, and we get, ta-da!, something we basically already knew! Also, this prophecy is very predictable and archetypal. (Did I spell that right?) Not what you'd expect from HP. It seems like J.K. put practically no ambition int the invention of this prophecy.3. THE DEATH: Like another customer said, there was absolutely no reason this character died. One gets the feeling that Rowling felt some sort of urge to put a death in solely to create a sense of tragedy, which she failed at horribly. So she kills a well-loved character for no reason at all, and then doesn't give us any closure on the death either! Horrible! (Not as bad as the prophecy though.)4. OTHER QUIBBLES:A. The book is over-stuffed with uselsess details that, undoubtedly, are the reason the book made it to the number of pages it is. With barely any plot to work with, there had to be 600 page filler! I seriously think that if you shaved the book down to only the plot, there only be about 100 or 200 pages.B. Although I don't feel as strongly about this as others, I do somewhat agree there's too much angst and sadness. It's sad/angry event after sad/angry event with Harry getting in deep trouble with Umbridge or the Ministry, and then getting barely saved by Dumbledore. I understand that Harry's 15 and also he's gone through some tough times but you think some happiness could have been stuck in there somewhere.C. Subplots that didn't go anywhere. Like Hermione's elf clothes and Grawp.D. It seems our old favorite characters, like Lupin, are also put in for filler. They hardly resemble their old personalities. They are just there.Now let's get on with the good:1.  THE TWINS: Yes, Fred and George were great in this book. They had a lot of funny shenanigans and played a bigger role. Their fairwell was fantastic. (The stuff Hogwarts legend is made of. It would've made the Marauders proud.)2.  UMBRIDGE: Yes, Dolores Umbridge was the cause of much of the angst I complained about earlier, but her characterization is wonderful. She is SO HATE-WORTHY, you wanna strangle her. She's the most despised character in the whole series. (Yes, more than Voldemort and Malfoy.) If Rowling can write characterizations that make you feel that strongly, you have to give her credit. A lot.3. THE VEIL AND THE ARCH are quite interesting and mysterious. Hints are given as to what it is, which makes it all the more mysterious and enticing to find out what exactly what it is in later books. (People who have read the book, you know the feeling. You know what I'm talking about.)  OVERALL:I'm hugely disappointed, and if Rowling doesn't improve, well, you know.

There are also a few revelations in this book that will lead to an unexpected climax of the series in the upcoming volumes.  This is definitely a must read for adolescents and anyone who ever was an adolescent.  It is an excellent read and superb reflection of the mind teetering between childhood and adulthood.

The theme in this book is almost too harsh and real for the young children stereotyped as typical Potter readers.

Although some elements remained the same with the previous two stories (a goofy episode with the Dursleys, another new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, etc.) there was a great deal new:  new information about Harry's parents and his godfather; new coursework at Hogwort's (and I'm increasingly convinced that there is an underlying tone of satire in some of this material); and new places to explore.To me, the biggest flaws included minor (but annoying) continuity checks between this volume and the previous two, and the sudden revelation concerning Scabbers the Rat.  Sorry, but this seemed contrived to me.Overall, though, while freely admitting that this series does not rise to the standard of ""high literature"", as a homeschooling parent, I find that I can't agree with the dire condemnations leveled at this series by some sources.

He frequently argues with his best friends Ron and Hermione, and is openly critical of the wizarding establishment, represented by the Ministry of Magic.  One of this book's many delights is seeing how J.K.

In ""Phoenix"", the focus is straight on the main characters, and their reactions to the evolving plot.  There are several emotional payoffs from situations set up in books 1-4, and several other very intriguing hints at plot points to come, such as the revelation about Snape's bitterness, and how Harry reacts to it.  We also learn why Lord Voldemort attacked Harry and his parents when he was a baby, and what it will ultimately mean to him.Rowling's ""tour-de-force"" grand finale comes during the final hundred or so pages of the book, where she stages a spectacular  battle royal that is as thrilling as anything in the series.  It is not just Harry and his nemisis Voldemort this time, but many other primary and secondary characters, both on the side of good, and of evil.

It's hard to pinpoint what the problem with the writing is, although I can start withtoo much familiarity  in the plot development.There is also alot of jibberish baggage in the subplot evolution, for instance - I forget who Cedric is, and what are Phineas?  It gets more complex as the plot thickens...Honestly now, JK Rowling has all the money in the world...I think she should stop writing now while people still pay attention.  Perhaps the sixth book will not be such a show stopper after # 5.  Have fun reading this one....it'll take a while.  All 870 * pages of it; pass the VISINE !",FALSE,2003,1464
"4823",5,731189,FALSE,"Everyone knows the basic plot due to the reviews and the hints, so I won't go into that. Basically, for the first 300 pages or so, I didn't really like this book. Harry Potter seems like a completely different character. He's angry and has a violent temper and he's not too likeable. Maybe J.K. Rowling wants us to see him as a normal teenager, but I don't know if she captured it correctly.  Sirius Black....such a disappointing character. Again, I guess the author is trying to make him seem real, but it's not in a good way.So why'd I give it 5 stars then? It gets good. It's one of those books where you get to page 650 or so, and you start thinking, ""Oh no, there's only 200 pages left."" You start getting used to the new Harry, unexpected things happen, there are several places where I laughed out loud due to funny remarks by the characters, and the book answers a lot of questions from the first ones.One thing I didn't like, though - The ""important character"" who dies...such a meaningless death. It'd be like reading in LOTR ""...and Gimli walked down the path, when suddenly a rock fell on his head, and he died.""  She/He didn't die heroically; more like they were just careless.But this is definitely a good book. I'm going to have to read it again to actually appreciate it. The dialogue is great.

"4824",5,731987,FALSE,"Hello all, I'm back again, fanatic HP fangirl that I am, to bring you a review on Harry #5, Order of the Phoenix. In this book, it begins with Harry and his cousin Dudley being attacked by Dementors. He is then rescued by the Order of The Phoenix, a secret anti-Voldemort organization founded by Dumbledore. He stays at Number 12 Grimmauld Place for several days(headquarters of OoTP) until his ministry hearing for using the Patronus charm in front of Muggles. We find out that someone at Privet Drive isn't as Mugglish as she seems.(Yes, SHE!) He gets off thanks to Dumbledore, who isn't looking at Harry for some reason. While dealing with this and the pressure of Lord Voldemort growing ever stronger, Harry returns to school, only to find himself under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, new DADA teacher. Hrry founds a secret society, D.A. to train kids how to fight You-Know-Who. It's a big hit. She and Fudge team up to get Dumbledore kicked out, and finally succeed when she becomes new Head of Hogwarts. Harry has a vision during his History of Magic O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) of Sirius trapped and tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries in the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville, and Ginny face quite a few Death Eaters and are battling for their lives when they discover that Sirius isn't there. But not long after that, Dumbledore and the Order come to the rescue. irius comes as well and dies. It climaxes in a battle upstairs in the MoM in which Dumbledore and Voldemort fight, and then Voldemort has a little surprise for Harry on his way out. Harry gets back to school and tries to deal with his Godfather's death and his guilt at bringing him to his doom. Dumbledore reveals some V.I.K.(Very Important Knowledge) that affects Harry very  hard. Excellent book, strongly written, smart plot line, and VERY many clues to the rest of the septology!

"4825",5,731912,FALSE,"I'll agree: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not the best novel in the Harry Potter series. However, it is still one of the best out there and far superior to any other book besides Potter. It is just that volumes 1, 2, and 3 of the Harry Potter series are so phenomenal that when we compare book 5 to the other, it pales just a little. I have a couple of problems with the book, but the rest of it is simply amazing. First of all, the most obvious, is the length of Order of the Phoenix: 870 pages. I felt that it was a little lengthy, and that some parts of the book could be cut so that there wouldn't be a little slow section in the middle. But the way some other reviewers talk, you would think it was way too long. Some people complain that it's too long for children, and even some adults, to endure. Believe me, I was twelve when I got the book (most people consider that to be still a kid), and I finished it within four days. It would have been shorter, but it was the end of June, and I still had a few more final exams to study for. Anyway, I will now officialy start my review. First the positives: there was a well-written, intricate, mystery that Rowling ingeniously put into book 5. It was a great improvement over the plot of book 4. Secondly, the character development was superb. You really feel the pain, anger, and suffering that some characters. For all those people who think that Harry is too moody in this book, what book were you reading?! Sure, he was a little moody, but it didn't affect the overall story. It had to happen. And for those who think that this book is to dark, what did you expect? The most evil wizard evil alive, who slaughtered countless innocents including Harry's parents, has returned and is now seeking revenge. Harry's peers and other wizards think that he is going insane because of the lack of proof he has to validate his story. Yeah, it's going to be dark. But, again, it isn't even that bad. Now, for the negatives: it was a little too long, and the editing was a little bad. Also, the ending was a little too ""Jerry Bruckheimer-ish"", or too much action and too little story. Third, I want to see more of Voldemort, a little more intensity, anger, and much more power. He's supposed to be the most evil wizard of all time. Will you please show us? I have hopes that the next book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, will be the best of the series to date. At least its shorter, with only 672 pages. To summarize my review, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix falls short of other Potter books, but it is the best book besides Potter, and one of the best books ever written. Well, that's my two cents.",FALSE,2005,2191

It's one I would say never to miss, if you were to skip a book in the series, I would say do not choose this one. The series continues to grow and florish, and this was the last of the current 5 I did not have trouble concentrating on.

All of the first chapters are usually garbage (with the exception of philosopher's stone). This one has 10 chapters, that's like 200 pages of boringness. It's essential the first time, but you'll probably want to read it again! The second is, J. K. Rowling wanted to make this book longer than Goblet, so she added some filler at the end, I mean, the last chapter consists of Harry thinking the same stuff over and over, in his depression, duuuh.

Magic, valiant heroes and evil villains, staunch friendships, and  wonderful mischief scamper through the halls of Hogwarts - Harry's  wizarding school - as a Rowling shows you life through the eyes of a  courageous young boy.  At the age of 11, Harry Potter had to step up to his  place of honor and danger in a world he never knew existed.  In his 2nd  year at Hogwarts, Harry was back in the thick of adventure while he dealt  with a new Dark Arts teacher as well as a few old nemeses from book 1.  Potter not only showed a bit more of his own courage and ability while at  the same time fighting a few of his own fears.  This tense theme continued  into the 3rd book, where Harry has much more to contend with than his own  past.  You will be amazed at the villains and heroes in this one - the  twists and turns had me reading from cover to cover more than once!  The  climax has a gripping level of suspense so you CAN'T put it down!  And,  once more, wise old Dumbeldor shows what it really means to be a wizard and  a hero as he helps Harry understand a bit more of himself!  (Please,  Rowling, don't ever lose this!  His wisdom makes us all think a bit more  about ourselves too!)  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a thought out  story as well as a good time.  Yes, it is a book targeted for children, but  as an adult I can even say that I sat, after reading it, just thinking.

I can't help it.  I like Star Wars and other wide epics that tell a good  myth.  Although I didn't start reading fantasy until after I went to  college, I have become a huge fan over the years.  Rowling creates a tight,  quick paced story that keeps you reading 'till the end, much like Tolkien  and Lewis (2 great authors)!

I thought that it'd be hard to top The Goblet of Fire, but I sure was put into my place!  Rowling furthers the story along wonderfully in this major turning point book, and keep you glued all the way through, on a plot with more twists than a roller-coaster.  But a warning to Harry Potter newbies: the last four books are ESSENTIAL to understand this one, so start at the beginning, or you will be completely and totally LOST!

The characters are more complex and Harry (who seems to be angry for a large part of the book) is growing, as he realises that his view of his father (and his hatred of Snape) needs to be reappraised. The story continues the darkening of tone begun in Azkaban and the wizarding world is now a more complex and political place than it may have seemed in the first few books. It is good to see the characters growing up and their perspectives adjusting. Although the writing style is still two-dimensional, the story and ideas made the book impossible to put down. JK Rowling has done amazingly well to come up with another book in this series which maintains such a hold on the reader. We are now reading it again.

The fifth book is definitely the most different one from all five books of the series. The flow of the book is somehow hollow and sometimes, the flow was stiff and (i can't believe i'm saying this!) boring! The book could have thinner than it is. There were many scenes which was too draggy and sort of kills off the excitement and anxiety of the readers. Some scenes, however, like how one character died was not thoroughly discussed. I had to read the page three times for it to really sink in that HE was dead. Until now, i am still not conviced that this particular character had died. It's like how the media said that Saddam Hussein was dead. I didn't believe it because there were no proof of his death. Now, my presumption was correct :He's still alive. I personally think that the character maybe alive, but perhaps in a different form or was just trapped or hidden 'somewhere'. Anyway, i thought that the fifth book was the least interesting as i had managed to put it down more than 50 times (something i found it hard to do when i was i reading the former four). The revelations made in this book was not as groundbreaking as i thought it would be. Not much progress on the character's development too, except for Harry who became very moody and emotional ( a sign of puberty ).Nonetheless, OoTP is still a must-have for all Harry Potter fans.

A lot of readers may think Harry's lost his charm since the first book, but Harry's not the 11-year-old we met back then.  He grows older and matures.  And, as shown in this book, he makes mistakes.  This is very much why I compare Book 5 to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back - both heroes make big mistakes by being rash, angry and reckless.

There are more surprises (beginning with the Dursleys' and then who becomes prefect, continuing all through to the very end of the book when Harry gets off the train in London).  The characters continue to grow, especially Neville Longbottom.  New characters add humor and strength (Luna Lovegood) and make you wonder where there place will be in the last two books.  Harry is typically clueless when it comes to women and romance, as are all men.  :)  Harry is also much angrier throughout the book, taking it out on his friends at times.  Here is where Rowling shines.  She adds more depth to the main characters (again, Neville is a case in point and he even outshines Hermione in the students' rebellious Defense Against the Dark Arts secret class), but also Ron (who finally makes the Quidditch team), Hermione, Fred, George).  Rowling is able to throw hints at the reader in the first books and then develop them (see Percy Weasley).  I'm trying not to give too much away because I was furious with the local newspaper reports putting spoilers in their headlines.  But the characters aren't static, as real people are not static.  They follow their character traits, sometimes miserably, but always logically.  The Weasleys' suffer what many families suffer, with a serious split in the family.Yet, despite the necessary darkness, there is always humor.  Hagrid finds a brother; the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher is the kind of teacher every person who has been in school will recognize; Gilderoy Lockhart makes an appearance--unfortunately as his memory starts coming back, so does his vanity; Nymphadora (love that name).There are also the losses (no spoiler here), and surprises.  Harry finds that his father wasn't always the hero that he thought and we find more of Harry's mother in him, in his character and not just his eyes.  At the end we find that the goodness, and love, in Harry is still what saves him from Voldemort.  And Dumbledore, who spends most of the book absenting himself from Harry, is also human, and can make mistakes (but then, if he hadn't been, we wouldn't have all the adventures, would we?).Wonderful book, wonderful storytelling.  And, speaking as a Christian, you have to love the message of self-sacrifice, the power of love, doing the right thing, standing up to evil no matter what form it takes, and willingly offering your life to save your friends.  That is what Christ asked of his followers.  Harry does react sometimes in extreme anger, and is frequently foolhardy, but his heart is always in the right place, even if his mind isn't clear.  The clue is at the end when he tries a crucifio curse (and think about the name of the curse!) and we are told why he can't do it with full affect.",FALSE,2003,1468
"4884",5,730407,FALSE,"Harry Potter starts this edition just like all the others, summer vacation at the Dursley's.  During this unsatisfactory summer, Harry learns about an escaped convict on the T.V.  This time, the Aunt Marge who we have heard a lot about decides to pay a visit.  During her visit, she dares to insult Harry's parents making Harry get mad, lose control and inflate the already chunky Marge.  He finally decides to run away from the Dursleys.  He is picked up by a wizard bus and dropped off at Diagon alley.  He meets Cornelius Fudge and he tells Harry that everything is fixed and that Harry can spend the next 2 weeks at the Leaky Cauldron.  Upon his return to Hogwarts, he is met by creatures called dementors who suck away happiness and leaves people with their worst memories, in Harry's case, his parent's death.  At Hogwarts, Hagrid has become the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, and during his lesson, the Malfoy we all know and hate is hurt because of his refusal to listen to Hagrid.  Harry later finds out that the escaped convict, Sirius Black, betrayed his parents and is a cause of his parents.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who can read.  Rowling has put her genius in another of her books. This book is filled with suspense, confrontations, emotion, and, best of all, quiditch, the sport of wizards.

There were many things in the earlier books that annoyed me (like everyone always muttering and gritting their teeth), but these annoyances either weren't there as much or I didn't notice them as much this time because this book is much better-written than the past ones. There are very few fiction authors that I enjoy - I am mostly a Stephen King fan - but Rowling's mix of good old-fashioned story telling, suspense, and humor have definitely won me over. One word of caution, though, this is NOT a childrens book. The first one may have been, but successive volumes have become more and more adult. Perhaps a good guideline would be that the reader's age match Harry's age in each book.",FALSE,2003,1517

Everyone's favourite characters from all the past four books will make appearances, often in surprising ways, and some familiar ones, such as Ginny and Neville, will be deepened and enriched.  Many questions are answered and some others are introduced.  There are suprises, fights, sullen teenagers and, even, a touch of awkward romance.

"4887",5,731189,FALSE,"The fifth, and most highly anticipated book in the Harry Potter cycle finds the hero very different from his previous incaranation - he's angry.  Angry at everything - dealing with girls, whose actions he can't understand, despite Hermione's patient explanations.  Angry with his friends, who Harry sometimes think don't appreciate his troubles.  Angry with the Ministry for trying to expel him.  Angry with the new Defense against the dark arts teacher, who is one of the few people that deserves his anger and hatred.  Angry at Snape, of course, who's still Snape.  Even angry at Dumbledore, with whom he has quite a row.This palatable anger gives this book a different feeling than the previous novels, yet also begins the real examinations of Harry's world, as he realizes for the first time that ""the world is not divided into death eaters and everyone else.""  Some of his anger stems at the continuous involvement of powerful magical forces in his life, but also at the realization that his parents were not perfect, and neither are many others.This novel is the first serious step in Harry's maturation, as he is now doing more than reacting to events around him, but rather initiates plans, some of which go disastrously awry.  So awry, he thinks, that they might have cost him a person quite dear to him.  Even more than the 4th book, this installment ends with a sense of trepidation and sadness that is quite rare in children's literature, and is somewhat surprising.  And for once, it has little to do with his need to return to the Dursley's house.Of course, the novel is populated with the usual cast.  (Of course, the defense against the dark arts will only stick around for one year:-)  Hermione and Ron are still there, as is Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy.  Harry's first crush, Cho Chang is also at school, and Ginny Weasely is given a larger role.  The Weaselys themselves appear throughout, as do Sirius, Remus Lupin, and nearly everyone from the past four books.This book, ultimately, sets up the final two books as a nearly stand alone conclusion.  Most of the mysteries surrounding Harry have finally been revealed, and he non realizes that he has a difficult future ahead of him.  Armed with this new knowledge he will have to forge ahead, and live with the difficult choices he will have to make.  Rowling accomplishes this transformation from Harry's childhood to adulthood rather well, despite being the limitations of writing to an audience of children.  The book is darker, angrier, and sadder, but Rowling's writing keeps the pages turning, and the same magic she has weaved in her previous books fill this novel.The Order of the Phoenix will not appease every single Harry Potter reader, but it is a worthy successor to its predecessors.",FALSE,2003,1468

Other readers (those like myself) who became more intrigued with the darkness and complexity of Books III and IV will thoroughly enjoy ""Order of the Phoenix"".870 pages gives Rowling a great deal of space with which to work. Her character development is superb. Harry continues his realistically painful transition from the innocence (or ignorance) of a youth to the experience of an adult.""Order of the Phoenix"" is a book of divisions. The question of truth regarding the Potter/Voldemort conflict of Book IV becomes a dividing issue in families, friendships, faculties, and even the wizarding government.Some of Rowling's best work in this book comes in the form of a short, plump woman named Dolores Umbridge. Her physical description incites no fear, yet this woman proves to be one of the most convincing antagonists in all the Harry Potter series. She thoroughly demonstrates the methods and movements of a politically driven genius. Her shaded methods demonstrate more cruelty and evil in their subtlety than any outright attack ever could. Even when a reader hates a villain, it must be accepted that there is a certain honesty that accompanies a straightforward attack. The subtlety and manipulation of the system by Umbridge make her a beautifully complex and (ultimately) more interesting villain.The action scenes contain some of the best and worst material in ""Phoenix"". One particular scene involving the Weasley twins is one of the most memorable Rowling has written. The final action sequence, though, drags on for far too long, slowing the pace of reading during a section that is of key importance.Action, intrigue, and insight into the workings of the human make Rowling's work both enjoyable and thought-provoking.

Though not as upbeat as the other books, with the looming prospect of OWL's and Lord Voldemort's undeniable return, this book explores Harry's character more thoroughly. In addition to exploring Harry more, the Rowling introduces a few new characters--Tonks, Mundungus, and the deeply hated Umbridge are just a few. Many have heard that Dumbledore explains many things to Harry (this is correct)--but he not only explains things, but he also shows his greatest weaknesses in this book. Rowling's writing becomes more and more descriptive and vivid as the book continues on and it is drawn quickly to a startling climax. In fact, I didn't even expect a climax because so many things happen, but the inevitable climax shows up and shocked me (nearly to tears). I got the book on saturday night and had finished it by monday night (lacking very much spare time for reading, so it's a pretty quick read). I'm going to leave it at this for fear of giving too much away; Rowling has proved her skill at authorship by bestowing us with yet another installment of this fantastical series that shows her incredible gift. The depth and beauty of this book couldn't be described in 1,000 words--it wouldn't be enough. I commend her awesome writing and look forward to the next two installments and for some more (possibly different) writing from her.

I refuse to give away any of the details for fear of spoiling this outstanding story for any who have yet to finish it, but Rowling has outdone herself this time! Many questions will be answered in this book, satisfying the curiousity that has plagued us for the last four books, but many other questions will be raised.  The most prevolent is: Who one will it be?Another question is:  How does Rowling keep both adults and children enthralled in these stories?  This series is transgenerational - crossing the barriers between ""kiddie lit"" and ""adult fiction.""  Critics of Rowling say these books are ""too dark and scary"" for children - they are dark.  They're supposed to be!  They were not originally intended to be childrens' literature, therefore the intended audience is not a 7 year old.  They are not a ""happy fairy tale"" with the assumed ending.

"4897",5,731900,FALSE,"I'm yet to overcome the amazement that this so-called ""for children"" books gave me since I was first introduced to the Harry Potter series a few years ago. I was reluctant to read it, dismissing it as just another pop-culture empty icon. But one day I finally decided to give book # 1 a chance, and I must confess it was a lot more than I expected. I read it overnight, in a rush of excitement over so simple an adventure, but one so magnificently crafted. It had the simplicity expected of a book for younger audiences, yet still it also had all the elements of a good thriller: brave but down-to-earth heroes, extremely evil villains, a solid plot with great and unexpected turns, mystery, suspense, et cetera. And, like I said before, very well crafted.Rowling has kept all those elements throughout the series, but with the particularity that, as the main characters grow older, so gain the stories in complexity and depth. Stephen King already said it about book # 4 on The New York Times, in an article in which he praised the ability of the author and remarked on how dark the story was, compared to what you would expect from your regular children story.In The Order of the Phoenix the reader will keep getting chills down his or her spine, with so much more evil that even hardcore fans would be surprised, and so much more humanity and weakness in Harry, as any teenager on the brink of maturity: self-doubts, fear, rage, among other feelings. Hence the more his greatness in being able to overcome those weaknesses.We also get to see and understand why Dumbledore is the greatest wizard of his time, and why he is the only one Voldemort really fears.

I think the book does a wonderful job at capturing what being 15 years old is like.It's a time and an age when emotions are crazy thanks to the new experiences of hormones - and you can see that with all the yelling that Harry does in the first hundred pages or so; at times it seems Rowling forgot to turn her caps lock off.The things that happen to Harry in this book can be emotionally draining, everything from the unfair way certain professors single him out to the larger problems tied up with who he is and the bigger problems he is involved with.  It's just like being a 15-year-old yourself through the experience of reading it.  That makes it a wonderful experience.  Even better are the bright moments, and I won't give them away, when the little triumphs bring the mood up to soaring heights.  Just like a teenager with dramatic body chemistry, you get to share those highs with Harry, too.If you are new to Harry Potter, start with the Sorcerers Stone and enjoy the books in order.

The complexity of the story is spectacular; Rowling pulls no punches in portraying the stresses and struggles of an adolescent under more pressure than any normal boy should be.  Gone is the thrill of adventure in Harry's exploits; instead, he and his friends encounter danger out of grim necessity.

I did feel bad for him, however his negative attitude got old after a while.  He had very little self-control and way too much anger especially toward the end of the book.  He kind of reminds me of Anakin Skywalker (Luke Skywalker's father) who in the 2nd movie ""Attack of the Clones"" was on the path to the ""Dark Side.""By the way, the one main character that dies in the book was totally unnecessary.  The press had an article about the author crying for having killed him/her off.  I, on the other did not cry, but was rather upset.

In the first four books, harry played the part of the innocent and fun-loving hero, but within this novel, he had a bad temper, an attitude, and a much larger disregard for rules than in the first four books  combined.As Harry tries to get his life together without losing his head, the threat of Lord Voldemort looms in the air, constantly reminding him of what he will eventually have to do: kill the dark lord, before he kills him first. Harry must battle Voldemort once again near the end of the book, but I won't spoil the details...I will warn all who have not read this book to keep a box of tissues with them at all times, it is extremely depressing and will leave you in tears several times... deaths are not the only sad things to occur within it...So we all fnd ourselves asking, what is The Order of the Phoenix?

Harry spends most of the book whining, and it got so bad I began hoping that Harry was the character that Rowling decided to kill off.  All the hype over the character who dies was the only thing that kept me interested.  But then I was SO disappointed when I finally got to the ""infamous"" death scene.

Although this book was very different in the sense that there really wasn't a specific event happening, (the triwizard tournament, sirius black's escape...) Rowling writes about many different events that occur in the wizarding world. At the center of the plot is the problem that the ministry refuses to belief the truth---that Voldemort has returned. Using the character of Dolores Umbridge, J.K. Rowling shows how dangerous a closed mind can be. I don't want to give away any of the plot (as was revealed...someone does die...it wasn't as much a surprise as cedric's death was), this is definitely a darker version of any of the other books.

In my opinion, this one is more like ""PG13.""All in all, this book can help children learn to move past the ""black"" and ""white"" of decision-making and move into an understanding of the shades of gray that are in the real world.

This woman added intensity, and hatred towards everyone (with the exception of the horrible, horrible Slytherins and Filch), in the entire school especially the teachers and Dumbledore. The whole moment towards the end was especially intense. Then falls to the devastation of a fallen beloved character loved by all (if not many) fans of the series and the character itself.

I hope somehow the Veil is explained thoroughly in the next book and mention somehow of Sirius in the future books as well... I liked how  Cedric was mentioned in this book even if its taken the wrong way... at least this way I can remember this character and I hope in Half-Blood Prince that Sirius is mentioned, too so I can remember him in his honor.The ending got a little happier when Harry pushed all the sad memories out of the way... that he has grown stronger thanks to Luna Lovegood, the only character in the entire story who understood Harry's feelings. And from that very moment, I grew to love her. Seeing that she's the only one who gave Harry's heartbreak a little mending.Wonderful story, overall.

The New York Times reviewer thinks he is like Prince Hal--growing, learning, changing as the story unfolds--and will ultimately be a great wizard. I agree.But in Book 5, he is a frustrated and frequently powerless 15 year old young man (not really a boy any more) trying his best to deal with his life.  Since Harry is not like ordinary boys, his life is somewhat more complicated.  He has girl trouble(guess who?) like any normal boy, but he also has a credibility problem involving the events at the end of Book 4.  He is frequently angry and frustrated, yelling at Ron and Hermione because he can't yell at the people causing his pain.

"4948",5,731934,FALSE,"I am writing this review after I read the sixth book in the series, so I have a better perspective than I did when I first read Order of the Phoenix. Because of my dissapointment with Book 6 I reread book 5 and asessed if I was just tired of Harry Potter after all these years. Thankfully I am not. So I decided to write this review.First allow me to say that this is the best of the six books available thus far.This book gives us answers to more questions, than any other book in the six available to date. In it you find out:* Why some poeple become ghosts and others do not.* The background Harry's Parents and Snape, when they were at Hogwarts. Important because JK Rowling did not take the easy way  out and portray them as saints and Snape as inherently evil. There definately is a great deal of humanity, some of it not so nice, in Harry's immediate lineage* Why Dumbledore would hire such an obvious fake as Trewlaney, the divination instructor.* Why Harry has to spend every summer with the Dursleys.* In the most chilling revelation, we are given the answer to how the seventh and as-yet-unpublished book has to end.In addition to all the presents above, the author gives us her most intriguing storyline to date. There are at least two very strong plotlines woven throughout this book.The first, Hogwarts has got a new Defense of the Dark Arts instructor. We expect this in every book. But, what I did not expect was a character as well fleshed out as the sadistic, power hungry Dolores Umbridge. From her little ""ahems"" to get attention, to her issuance of ""Educational decrees"" this is a character we love to hate. Whovever is cast to play this in the 2007 movie will have big shoes to fill. By the end of the book Hogwarts is a virtual dicatatorship. When the students revolt, it satisfies every pent up desire a kid or an adult for that matter has ever had to get rid of that particular teacher/boss (and we all had one) and send them ignomiously packing.The second plotline is that the war between Voldemort and the Wizarding world is finally heating up. Characters that we always suspected as being in Voldemort's camp come out and reveal their true colors. This culminates in an all out attack on the Ministry of Magic to steal a very important prophesy. It also results in the death of a major character.This is far darker in tone than books 1-4 but, it is a darknes resulting from maturity of the plotline and the author. We know we are in for a blacker story, when the summer at the Dursleys is not fun or funny but, very perilous for both them and Harry.This is one of the longest books in the series. It is also the most statisfying. I would not edit a single page out of it, if I could.When this book first came out there was a phenomena known as Harry Potter Headaches. These were caused by prolonged periods of intense reading. This is a book you can not put down once you start it. SO beware plan a good stretch of time in your schedule once you start it.All in all a great read. My Advice buy this, read it, skip the mess that is book 6 until you can get your hands on book 7 and enjoy. It truly is a satisfying and magical journey into the world of JK Rowling's Harry Potter.",FALSE,2005,2213
"4949",5,731189,FALSE,"""To be, or not to be"", that is the question that brooding Harry Potter asks himself in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  J. K. Rowlings' teenage Harry Potter has taken on the self-examining, introspective tones that exemplify another great character in British literature, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.  The parallels are numerous. Hamlet's father is dead; Harry's parents are dead.  Hamlet has the weight of the world on his shoulders; Harry is the only person who has stood up to Lord Voldemort.  (warning, plot spoiler in the next sentence)  Harry faces death yet again in installment 5.  He seems, momentarily, ready to let go, just like Hamlet. ""Let the pain stop, thought Harry.  Let him kill us ...""  Harry's life gets ever more complex as he gets older. Hamlet's mother and uncle are concerned about his state of mind from thebeginning of the play.  His mother asks him to leave the memory of his father behind, butHamlet cannot.  Harry starts the fifth book in Rowlings' series lying in the garden outsidethe Dursley's trying to overhear the news.  He is depressed because he doesn't know whatis going on and it seems his friends have abandoned him.  Harry spends much of the booktrying to figure out what is going on with his two main male role models, the cabin-fevercrazed Sirius Black and the suddenly reserved Albus Dumbledore. In this book, we see Harry make an effort of sorts to interact with members of theopposite sex.  Unlike Ron and Hermione's Beatrice and Benedick love/hate relationship,Harry and Cho are doomed from the start.  Hamlet may or may not be in love withOphelia, but in any case he sure doesn't know how to woo a young woman; Harry andCho Chang have issues too.  While Harry was the only witness to the death of Cho'ssweetheart Cedric, Hamlet, in fact, kills Polonius - Ophelia's father .  Harry doesn't tellCho to go to a nunnery, but he can't even make it through a date on Valentine's Daywithout making her burst into tears and flee. If the first three books were charming and delightful, book 4 marks a turn to adarker sort of writing which only becomes more foreboding with Harry's angst in book 5.Still, Harry, unlike Caesar, does not need anyone to whisper in his ear ""Remember, thouart mortal"" nor do I expect Dumbledore to divide Hogwarts among his three daughters.  Ifinished reading book 5 by 9 p.m. on the 21st of June and I am, like everyone else, eagerlystarting the clock on books 6 and 7.

"4950",5,731189,FALSE,"There's an early Friends (the TV series) episode where Phoebe is hired to sing for a NYC library. Contrary to what parents expect (barnyard animals, fairytales), her songs, in wacky Phoebe tradition, are about death of grandparents, sex, and the meat industry. After being fired, the children find her out, and come to listen to her songs at Central Perk, calling her ""The Lady who Tells the Truth"". Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the latest in the wildly popular adventures of the boy wizard and his friends at Hogwarts School or Witchcraft and Wizardry, is- and believe the hype- darker and angrier than the previous books- mostly because its hero, Harry is so. Adolescence isn't easy for Harry, and the solid stoicism and light-hearted sensibility of the first two books is mostly gone. Remember the Ron of Goblet of Fire, and you have the Harry of the Phoenix. (but the longer, extended version).Fans who've loved the books because of the meticulously constructed fantasy world of magic will find in this book to have less of the Everyflavor Beans and school feasts or the sensible yet irreverent approach to magic education (dreary to Harry and Ron, not to Hermione); the practical other-world of Harry Potter is invaded by so-far the scariest character in the series, DAD teacher Dolores Umbridge, whom J.K. Rowling has described as having a personality like ""poisoned honey"". The regular life (the ""recipe"" as some have called the Potter books) of Hogwarts is turned upside-down as Umbridge destroys the security that makes the Potter-verse such a wonderful place to escape to.On top of this, Harry goes through adolescence as I've never read elsewhere: stormy, angry, and explosive. His awkward first relationship with a girl (no spoilers here) is both embarrassing and funny (mostly due to Hermione's translation of ""girl talk""). One might think this would be the Potter book to stay away from- too scary for the younger kids, too painful for adolescents.But after staying up all night after the midnight sale on June 21st and finishing it by Saturday morning, I have to give OotP 5 stars, and the verdict of ""best Potter book"" (so far, and crossed fingers for the future ones). Remember the previous books: was Harry's life at the Dursley's ever carefree?; wasn't the Chamber of Secrets or the final scenes of Goblet of Fire chilling and horrific? wasn't Harry always going through trials and even ostracizing from Hogwarts students and Muggle-world combined? After all, the return of Voldemort, announced at the end of Goblet, isn't just a final exam.Order of the Phoenix, though diverging from some aspects of the previous books, is a great read, impossible to put down, and an amazing account of growing up.After all, it tells *the Truth*...",FALSE,2003,1468

Now that I've finally gotten it and read it (straight through) I can say that I came out with mixed feelings. I dont want to give anything away, so I'm going to be vague. Those of you who are HP fans will know what I'm talking about. Simply put Book 5 was nothing that I thought it would be. We meet up with Harry of course at the beginning of the book,as well as Hermione and Ron and the rest of the groupies. They arent however, cutesy little kids anymore. HP and his friends are 15, and considered in all rights to be young adults. They face obstacles and challenges more than Voldermort, the challenge of growing up and dealing with adolesonce. We meet new characters and become reaquainted with the old ones we have all come to love and hate. Year 5 for the students brings two prefects for each house, a new defense against the dark arts teacher (surprised?), a new Gryfindor keeper, and an array of other new devolpments. I return to the mixed feelings I stated earlier. Book 5 is dark. Darker than I imagined it would be. There is less humor and about 890 pages to finally figure out EVERYTHING you wanted to know about Harry's past. Character devolpment is deeper, and sometimes it feels like you wish you hadn't read that sentence or paragraph because your views will be sorely tested on your favortie characters.

And though Harry may still make stupid, selfish  decisions, Rowling has grown immeasurably as a storyteller. My biggest  complaint about the last book was that things were not set up very well;  were too dependent on luck, convenience, and chance. Here, the plot is very  carefully orchestrated, as evidenced by the time-twisting finale. Rowling  really did her homework when putting this book together.

A few points.Harry was darker, meaner a bit of a little punk, but *SPOILER ALERT* He was possesed by Voldermort for half the book what did you expect?!  Also I was glad he stood up to Ron and Hermione a few times.  All that modest hero stuff can't go on for too long oherwise it makes the character unreal.  All of us want to be appricated.  Next point, I still don't understand why the character that dies had to die.  It happened to quick I had to reread a few time to make sure I had read right.

The twins were awesome, I can't wait to see their last prank on the big screen, the prophecy I think will bring a closer friendship to Harry and Neville.  Also I think Harry has really started to grow up, which I am glad for.  Also that got over Cho, she cries more than I do and that is an accomplishment.  I hope Ron sees his full potential, Lupin plays a bigger role, and that there is MORE QUIDDITCH in the next book.  Over all appricate it for what it is, a great book, a fun yet dark at parts read.

"4955",5,731191,FALSE,"One of the great strengths of the Harry Potter series, outside of the fact that it got millions of kids to turn away from the TV long enough to pick up a book, is the realism with which it portrays its characters. This book is no exception.Realism? In a book about magic? Well, certainly not in that aspect, no. But this book rings absolutely true in its portrayal of a Harry who is finally coming of age; a Ron and a Hermione who bicker like a married couple, foreshadowing further developments between the two that were hinted at in the fourth book; even in its portrayal of a regretful, world-weary, Dumbledore who is more than just a wise-old wizard. These characters are not simple sterotypes, and this book proves it.Backing up a bit, the story in this book is top-notch, with a rather dark and scary, action-filled  plot that begins almost straight away and doesn't really ever let you go until the end. More than any of the other books this one has a real forward drive to it, but still with excellent pacing and development. All the major characters and locations are back from the previous book, some greatly changed or expanded in role, some less so. I am purposefully avoiding giving too much plot information in this review so as not to spoil it for those who have not read this or other books in the series. Suffice it to say, newcomers and old fans will not be disappointed with the construction of this novel.Returning to the issue of characterization, I felt, reading this book, like the words, the actions, the emotional responses of the children in the pages were perfectly real, akin to the way I or my friends might have acted at the tender age of 15. Romance plays a larger role for the now adolescent protagonists; childish teasing has given way to more threatening confrontations; and it becomes clear that the teachers and students are on ever so slightly more equal footing, as the students grow older and more skilled. This sort of portrayal is rare in a book, especially a work of fantasy such as this one--the fact that it is done so well here is all the more surprising.I do not claim that J.K. Rowling has created a work of fine literature on a par with Jane Austen or Charles Dickens. But she has bult a world that stands on its own but feels real and substantial. This book adds to that world completely successfully and also maintains itself as an excellent and fun read that is also interesting and thought-provoking. Children and adults alike, pick this book up, tear through it as I did, and the only disappointment you will feel is that the next one is years away.",FALSE,2003,1470
"4957",5,731180,FALSE,"I admit it--I'm addicted to Harry Potter, that fascinating boy wizard wonder who took us all by storm a few years ago.  Now in his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry has become a teenager with all the moodiness and hormonal attacks accompanying it.J. K. Rowling had the option to keep Harry a boy, but she chose to apply his adolescent development and increased learning at Hogwarts to a thrilling tale of dark magic.  In doing so, she also complicated the story so that it may become increasingly more difficult for young readers to keep up with what's happening in Harry's teenage years.  Readers must also endure a heavy 870-page hardcover book which took this Ph.D. nearly a week to read!Ms. Rowling's classical and British background pervade Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  From the sections of London such as Elephant and Castle to the use of names like Professor Umbridge and Kingsley Shacklebolt, she enlarges the American vocabulary base while telling an intense tale.What is astounding to me in this book is the degree of anger and darkness not evident in the first four Harry Potter books.  This level of intensity is appropriate for several reasons.  First, Harry is entrenched in adolescence, and his moodiness and interactions with Cho, the love of his life, have him becoming instantly angered at everyone and everything.  In addition, he doesn't understand why Dumbledore, the grand wizard and school headmaster, won't even look at him.  Second, only Harry and Dumbledore believe that the Dark Lord, Voldemort, has returned.  The Daily Prophet, the wizard world newspaper, continuously mocks them both.  Third, in the fifth year, wizards must pass the O.W.L., the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams.  These will make the year tougher without adding the usual assortment of crises facing Harry each of the previous years.Finally, with Voldemort about and his godfather, Sirius Black, unavailable to him, Harry must go it somewhat alone.  His anger turns off his regular comrades--Ron and Hermione--who try to stick by him as always, regardless of his moodiness.  Added to the clique this year are Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood, a wifty sort of character new in this book who adds a bit of mystery to the story.Without giving away the ending, I can only say that Rowling wraps it all up and ties it together nicely with Dumbledore's explanation of the past, the present, and the future.

Needless to say, I had never read them (it is rather easy to base contempt on ignorance).  Then, I saw the movies, which in turn inspired me to read the novels.  I was floored.  I instantly shed the cloak of the gainsayer and dressed myself in the robes of an admirer.  Certainly my transformation is not unusual.  Neither was my anticipation for the fifth book.  Having missed the bruhaha of the first four releases due to my erstwhile foolhardy stance, I plunged wholeheartedly into the chaos of OoP's release.  I attacked the book with relish, spurred on by my zeal and the book's addictive nature.  I was  thrilled.  The fifth book is marvelous.  I think it suffers somewhat from following the Goblet of Fire, an all-out masterpiece.  Why, imagine if Beethoven had composed a tenth symphony!  Still, despite being in the shadow of Goblet, OoP can be cherished as the next phase in the Hogwarts saga.  It is wonderfully written and is chock-full of action.  Most of this action is, I find, character development, but is not internal action even more important than external?  It allows us to understand the characters' behavior.  OoP is a wonderful and necessary part of the HP story.  Remember, these are episodes in the life of Harry, and are the stories of his times.

I finished it in a month-I had my finals after X-Mas break-probably the fastest yet. It is the longest HP book to date at 870 pages and 38 chapters long-the first was only 309 pages and 17 chapters. Even though I do wish that Ms. Rowling would keep them shorter, this book was truely good. We see Harry go through the madness and angst of his past-we do find new information about his past. It isn't a huge twist but does explain a lot. And we also see him struggle around girls, especially Cho, who is still mourning over Cedric.

For Potter fans reading this, I courted my wife in Duke Humphrey's Library in Oxford, a 15th century library which was used in the films for the Restricted Section of the Library at Hogwarts!

It sort of reminds me of the old Enid Blyton books like Famous Five or the Secret Seven that I used to read. You know, kids going on adventure solving them and saving the day. Its probably why adults love HP as well an its en vogue to be seen toting a HP book. Adults naturally themselves like to be able  to enjoy again the simplistic world of little children, far from our problematic world.However thats where the similarity with the old Enid Blyton books end. HP actually grows with you. If you started of reading from the first HP book and actually waited for the next installment ( I didn't) you would actually be growing with the book. And nowhere is this fact clearer than in the 5th book in which Harry has had to deal with more things than he did in the 1st. This book actually gives you alot of missing answers and ties up the lose ends of the older books. It also has to be the darkest and perhaps saddest one yet. Then again I said that in the 4th, but the 5th turned out darker, so who knows with the 6th. There's alot of grumblings that Harry is irritatingly whiny in this 5th book and I would agree, but do bear in mind it makes it more realistic..weren't you that whiny when you were 15?Only thing is..with all the answers given out, like why Voldemort tried to kill Harry in the first place, the 6th and 7th book can hardly hold any more mystery for us. What has kept us reading through all the way to the 5th is the fact that we were trying to get more answers.

The first four books all shared one commonality -- a plot that built the tension until that one final fight between Harry and ""he-who-must-not-be-named,"" who first took on the form of various others, but then finally fought Harry as himself.  The last hundred pages of the first four novels were so suspenseful that I could barely force myself to take a break long enough to turn the page.  But this latest installment kept me waiting for the good part to come.  Yet it never did.  Sure, we got our expected final battle between the forces of good (i.e. Harry & Co.) and evil (i.e. Voldemort and friends), yet it just lacked the sizzle and excitement to which Rowling has allowed us to become accustomed.  I liked it much better when Harry came to his own rescue, astonishing all with his abilities; having another wizard come to his rescue was a disappointment.  And that final secret that Dumbledore ""should've told Harry five years ago..."" -- well duh!  Was there any new information there?  Every reader above age five had to have figured that one out around chapter 12 of the first book.I'm still a Harry fan, and I'll likely be in line at midnight for the release of the sixth installment, but I sincerely hope that Rowling can recapture the ""magic"" with which she infused the first half of her series.",FALSE,2003,1471

I love the Harry Potter series, and I believe that they got better and better through the 4th book.  The 3rd and 4th books were my favorite up until I read this one.  However, it still holds true that 3 and 4 are my favorites.  I say this no to discredit the 5th, but to tell you that it isnt as enjoyable due to the events that take place in the 5th.  If you are reading this, then you probably know that Lord Voldemort returned to power at the end of the 4th.  I knew that the 5th would be dark, but it was a little too dark to be enjoyed as much as the previous books.  Much of the book has a depressing tone, due to the fact that Harry is in fact depressed.  It can make for a somewhat depressing read at points, and the end provides less resolution than even the 4th, which seemed to be the one to open up a whole new branch of books in which Voldemort is out terrorizing people again.  I do not want to give anything away, but the ending was very unsatisfying, and will probably frustrate most readers.  Despite all my complaints, it still definitely lived up to the rest of the Harry Potter books, and even though I did not enjoy it as much as I would have hoped, it was exactly what Rowling had intended with this chapter of the series, and was an excellent book overall.

All of this did lead up to the climax, where harry met Lord Voldemort, but that was only about a chapter or so long out of 38 chapters. i also feel that the stories are getting a bit monotonous, like you can predict what is happening - of course, the gang of 3 will figure out a mystery which all leads up to Lord Voldemort, and harry defeats him, which leads up to another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. dont get me wrong though, this was a great book, and it had some great elements. the mystery was, as usual, very suspenseful, and one of the main characters gets over their fear of saying Voldemort's name. i'm sure you've heard about the 'death' in the book, which does, by the way, happen. i'm not going to tell you who it is, because that spoils everything, but it is very shocking, i must say, and quite sad as well. neville longbottom has a larger part in this book, and as dumbledore explains at the end, he is very important. overall, this is a great read, and it disappoints me that i have to give it a 4, but it just wasnt as good as the other 4 books. expect to put a long while into reading this, for 870 pages is quite a bit.",FALSE,2003,1484

Perhaps Ritalin should happen to me. But this book is bound to quite the most hyperactive of readers. Sort of velcro with a bookmark.There were a few surprises for me. This book is much darker than the others. I had heard that the book was written for a reader at least as old as Harry is in the book, and I do agree that this book is fine for 15 year olds, but I might steer it away from the truly young reader. Heck, with over 2000 pages of Harry Potter reading in the first 5 books it'll take-em a bit to get to this one anyway.Back to writing.

As the characters age and mature the writing does as well.  While the others might be considered children's books or young adult reading material, this is more young adult to adult reading. You definitely get your money's worth for the book.  As a matter of fact it's a bargain for the entertainment value.  I liked the book because it stood on its own, independently of the others, even though I'd have had to have read it regardless because I'm familiar with the characters and want to know what happens to them.

Even if you're a hopeless Muggle (her term for a mundane, nonmagical person), it's interesting to look at the ordinary world from a would-be wizards perspective. Perhaps best of all, she's captured what real school is like for normal kids -- the fact that it's wizardry that's being taught doesn't dilute the familiar spots from our own schooldays, from Harry's rivalry with the school bully Malfoy and his cronies, to ups and downs of teachers and classes, to snooping around and rulebreaking, to the sheer joy of playing in a team sport.Truthfully, while it's written for kids, there's lots of subtleties that the adults will appreciate -- anybody else ever think that Dumbledore giving all those points out at the last minute was a sly way of handing Harry, Ron, and Hermione a cookie for saving the school's collective butts, without admitting that it ever happened?The only thing that I dislike about this series is the message that it sends to kids that it's okay to break all the rules you want, as long as you're doing the right thing. I'd like to see a book that shows the value of knowing when NOT to break the rules. It's a fine line to walk, but an important one.

The plot is interesting, as always, and there are plenty of curious details to sort out so that the reader (if she is already a Harry Potter fan) will be led along.  I do not think the book would be considered well written by a first time reader, however.  Also, the ending seems overly designed to make the reader crave the next book. I expected better.

Above all, Harry and his friends overcome a lot and at the end like always there is a big adventure, in this one they fight together with their friends Neville, Luna and Ginny. I love all the members of the Order: Moody, Tonks, the Weaslys, Lupin, Sirius and Snape, whom I think keeps a big secret of why he turns from the dark side and is SO trusted by Dumbledore. Unlike almost all Harry Potter fans I think Snape's character is very deep and mysterious, I am really hoping J. K. Rowling develops him more in her next book.For me, the death of an important character was completely unnecessary, I even think the way she wrote it was not ideal, it lacked emotion and sense, it is sad to know that we would not be able to read and enjoy that character anymore.

"4995",4,731190,FALSE,"In the 5th book of the Harry Potter series, Rowling concentrates on an atmospheric description of life after the return of Lord Voldemort. Chief conflict dividing the wizarding world (and the Weasley family) is whether to believe the Ministry of Magic's assurances that Harry Potter and Dumbledore are mistaken, alarmist doomsayers out for admiration and personal power, or to believe the ridiculed parties themselves and face the most unpleasant news. Among Dumbledore's supporters in the Order of the Phoenix are Sirius, Lupin, and the Weasley parents. Their chief antagonist is the new, ministry-appointed Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, who supplants Dumbeldore as headmistress and establishes an Orwellian rule at Hogwarts.Much room is also given to Harry's feelings of loneliness and rebellion against authority, including the new headmistress, the father figures Dumbledore and Sirius, as well as his friends. Cho Chang, who aroused Harry's interest by the end of book 4, keeps him in further emotional turmoil.While the descriptions are atmospheric and tight, foreshadowing a life under Voldemort, and the teenage tantrums and emotional roller coasters are vivid an well-written, the book does not have the tight, action-filled plot of, for example, book 4. It is only in the last 3rd of the massive tome that the speed of events picks up to a fulminant confrontation, in which one of the main characters dies at the hands of Voldemort's supporters.

Actually, I considered Goblet of Fire to be the best in the series for a long time, but rereading this tome again finally convinced my opinion to change.The difference is simple; more story.There's a rediculous amount of story packed in 'Order of the Phoenix', which despite being the longest HP book yet, flows smoothly. Rowling took her time with this one, (3 years), and it shows.This is a far, far darker book than 'Half-Blood Prince', continuing the thematic descent in books 1-4--every year means more loss, more confusion, less happiness. Why is this the darkest book? Oh boy, let's recap:--The biggest factor in tension has to do with the Ministry of Magic's reaction to Voldemort's return. It's an all too familiar real-life scenario of governmental cover-ups, and believing your friend on blind faith...themes that I never thought would be in a fantasy novel, but work brilliantly here as Harry is torn apart from chapter one.--Any act of heroism, or bit of happiness, or even telling the truth is quickly destroyed by Umbridge, who is one of Rowling's finest creations. She claims her place as most memorable-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for sure, stooping to levels that take the story into darkness that 'Goblet' couldn't touch. She is the largest of Harry's many thorns, and he is powerless.--The usual workload takes a new level of stress for all fifth years as they have to study for the O.W.L.S.--shades of ACT-type stress.--With Wood gone, poor Harry has to pretend being impressed by Ron's quiddich skills.--Ron and Hermione, AND Malfoy are Prefects? What about Harry?--One on one Occlumency lessons with Snape? Yeah, that'll be fun.--Where's Hagrid?--Cho, who is a much different person than Harry predicted in 'Goblet.'--We can't forget Dumbledore, who is the steadiest character of absolute good in the series. What is he doing this year? Avoiding Harry as much as he can.--As has been discussed, the main element of this year that stands out (even from book 6) is Harry's temper. OF COURSE he's going to be ticked off the whole book. He doesn't exactly start off well in this book, and every single aspect of his life is now a test or fight, and he fails more than succeeds. It's a simple truth--he's a flawed hero, and the more the flawed he is, the more interesting the read.Fortunately, Harry does have his friends Hermione and Ron, and his little group is appropriately doubled near the end, considering what they are up against. (Go get 'em, Neville!) There are good things in his life, but the overwhelming darkness is always present on every page. Just when you think things can't get any worse, they somehow do. The TRIPLE climax of this sucker is so powerful on so many levels, it needed five books to rise to this level. There's more emotional development (heroism, heartache, loss, rage, confusion, love, regret, sadness) in the last 150 pages than in all of the 4 previous books. Don't believe me? Reread this again.",FALSE,2005,2223
"5024",5,731191,FALSE,"How decidedly, impeccably right Professor McGonagall was, in Harry's debut book, in exclaiming ""every child in our world will know [Harry's] name""! Not even Rowling herself imagined the insatiable Harry-mania that would explode and spread throughout the world like wildfire. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the latest sequel to the delightful, nearly legendary Harry Potter saga that has captivated millions, adults and children alike, all around the world. Just precisely what it is about Harry that makes him so popular is difficult to define. There is the intangible ingredient in every book that fuels our imagination and makes the reader feel more alive; the effective combination of fantasy, realism, mystery, and ancient myths and having the outcome emerge as something very original; the manner in which Rowling ensnares words onto paper in a most enchanting and wonderful way; and the fantastic way of Harry's world being both dauntingly real and perplexingly magical simultaneously are what have the Muggles of the world holding their breaths and incessantly waiting for news from a world we all have come to fervently believe in.To those readers, who have been completely enraptured by Harry's realm and who have delved into those books time and time again, it is a pleasure to again read Rowling's enthralling language, to delight in the hidden sarcasm and humor, and to notice that her writing has ameliorated drastically from the first book, though she has not lost her style and grace-quite the contrary. What I especially like about Harry, and what makes him different from all the Famous Five type heroes, is that he grows, changes, and becomes a more well-rounded character in every book, and with each new addition to the series, the story becomes more and more complex and multi-layered. Each time you understand Harry's past better and are able to appreciate more fully the deeper views into the magical world that Rowling offers the reader.The Order of the Phoenix, the enjoyment of which cannot be at its maximum if the previous works are not known, is the fifth book and a must-read for Muggle and magical folk alike. It is the pivotal book in the series, and transforms the happy-go-lucky, innocent Harry of the first four into a more mature, deeper, and darker teenage boy. It sets the foundations for the next books, and gives a taste of the dark, insecure life that will be the norm if nothing is done to prevent Voldemort's rise to power. The Order of the Phoenix is different from the previous books also in the sense that it is very political: Professor Umbridge is the new tyrannical Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts and very soon the reader despises the character with such efficacy that it, if possible, rivals even the repugnance and hatred one is accustomed to feeling whenever Professor Snape appears.The book continues Harry's story right where The Goblet of Fire left off, and, in my opinion, the adventure begins without delay. It's a compelling page-turner from start to finish-the full intimidating 870 pages. In The Order of the Phoenix, Harry is fifteen and shows definite signs of being a teenager. His thoughts are shadowed by his disturbing past, and the future does not look very bright either, as Voldemort has returned and, as The Daily Prophet has turned Harry into a raving lunatic, the magical world does not believe him and do not heed his warnings of the return of the Dark Wizard. The reader is plunged into his frustration and anger, disappointment, shame, and extreme guilt, and even sympathies towards Professor Snape and loathing of James Potter. Albeit the occasional and very welcome Rowling-style laugh-out humor is ever-present in this fifth book as well, the overall tone is very dark, somber, oppressive, and, especially towards the end, unfathomably sad. The book ends abruptly, far too soon: the story lacking a real, concrete grand finale as in the other books results in the conclusion being somewhat equivocal-although one must take into consideration that it is the turning point in the series and most likely the sixth one will be a continuum of this. In all of the four previous ones, Harry has been the celebrated hero, and has saved the day, but now all he-and the reader-is left with is abysmal grief and guilt.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a delicious sequel to Rowling's renowned books, exceeded even high expectations, and left a decided craving for more Harry, a yearning for the sixth book, and a curiosity concerning the next Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher.

"5025",5,731192,FALSE,"...I don't think that I need to delve too deeply into a synopsis, since most of you will already know the basic storyline. The fifth book picks up for the most part where Goblet of Fire left off. The first thing thatwill occurr to you upon picking this book up is its size. J.K. Rowling's epic books have gotten progressively longer and thicker since Sorcerer's Stone, for he better. Many of us complained about the prolonged (and often changed) date of release for the fifth book, but like so many other books and movies, the wait was well worth it. Rowling did her self great justice in the expanse of time that it took her to complete this novel and I dare say most of us agree that she did not let us down one bit. On the contrary, she exceeded my expectations (I felt that all of her newly acquired fame and wealth would hinder her writing in a way) and has produced a masterful, whimsical adventure (which remains true to the series as a whole), which also explores darker literary archetypes, a welcomed change. If one word (which doesn't due the book justice of course) could sum up Harry Potter and The Order of the Pheonix, it would be 'change.' Change for the better in my opinion. I felt, while reading, that Rowling realized that the basic plot of the other four books--Harry, Ron, and Hermione discovering sinister plots and conspiracies (through a bit of eavesdropping); gettting themselves into loads of trouble while piecing together the puzzle; finding out He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's connection with the puzzle; and finally, Harry vanquishing the danger and thwarting Voldemort's plans with assorted means of help--were drying out out, and not leaving much room for expansion. Nothing of course is wrong with this (why mess with success?), and I certainly love the books, but I think that a little change has suited the series nicely. The precursory of this massive amount of change was of course Cedric Diggory's death and Dumbledore's announcement to the Wizarding community that You-Know-Who is back. In the fifth book change practically seeps from the pages. All of the main characters are back (save Diggory and of course the graduates of last year) but will undergo major changes. Harry fights off Dementors in a Muggle-populated area (while saving Dudley no less!); Dumbledore is discredited and mocked in the wizarding community; Harry is introduced to a secret Order, founded by Dumbledore, and to which his parents belonged and died for, that is combating Voldemort's followers; Ron is made prefect over Harry and then becomes Griffindor's new Keeper; Harry is having strange visions and premonitions that forsee the future and even the present; Owl's year is upon then; the Ministry takes over Hogwarts; Dumbledore is disbanded from Wizarding orders and as Headmaster at Hogwarts; Hagrid is fired, McGonnagal injured; and Voldemort more powerful then before. The list goes on and on but as you can see change has both hightened the enjoyability of the book and added a more mature side to the seriers. As an adolescent now, one could only expect Harry to have to deal with the problems that us teens face daily. Girls (Cho Chang, namely), schoolwork, family, obligations, and anger with the world. Yes, Harry is a much angrier person in this book, one who isn't afraid to vent at anyone, and who wears his emotions flamboyantly on his sleeves. Rowling also deals with more mature concepts such as the fact that there are other forces in the world besides good and evil. And in the end Harry is faced a startling revelation and ultimatum: kill or be killed. A Neanderthal-esque philosophy that is possibly the oldest theme of all: survival of the fittest. Well I'm not sure how much I've actually said about my feelings towards the book. It's compelling (I stayed up 3 days straight, only taking cat-naps, to finish it); laughable (Ron's antics, Hermiones' nagging and fussing, Fred and Georges' pranks and ruses, and Mr. Weasley's on-going obsession with Muggle items are histerical); dramatic and suspensful as always (in one scene, Sirius, Lupin, Mad-eye Moody, Tonks, Kingsley Shackbolt, and Dunbledore later, duel with a garrison of Deatheaters, who include Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange, to protect Harry and Company); and just a great all around read. Rowlings has always masterfully depicted Hogwart's but she really shines in this book, in adding and describing other locales where the story takes place. New characters also grip the scenes, while subordinate characters get their time in the sun. I can honestly say that I have not read a book that stirred such emotions within me (we can all relate with either Sirius or Harry in their feelings of inadequacy and anger at being forgotten and left out of the loop, from some time in our life) and held my interests from the first word to the very last (some near 800 words later). No more than merely held my interests, Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix WAS my sole interest for 72 hours straight (minus the cat-napping). I could not have thought of a better way to start my summer than journeying to Hogwart's, and beyond, on Harry and Company's latest journeys through life...and ultimately death for one character. The plot has thickened (always a treat for me) and matured (very much welcomed). Great book. Must read for ALL ages. You'll love it.",FALSE,2003,1471
"5027",5,731190,FALSE,"I finished this one yesterday, after a couple marathon days of reading.  I have enjoyed all of the books in the series, with Goblet of Fire (#4) standing as my favorite until now.  I'm still not sure if Order of the Phoenix tops it, I'll have to read it again to be sure.  One thing is certain, though...  Harry is growing up.This book is the darkest of the series to date.  It begins darkly, and stays dark throughout, with a few lifts of humour here and there.  Overall, though, it doesn't have nearly the levity of the others in the series.  Of course, considering the events currently taking place in Potter's world, this should come as no surprise to Rowling's readers.Rowling does a great job of balancing character and plot development, and she gives plenty more detail on life in the wizarding world, for those of us who love the fantastic elements of these stories.  And with Harry and his classmates sitting for the O.W.L. (Ordinary Wizarding Level) exams this term, there's plenty of opportunity to learn more about the subjects they study and the career paths open to them when they've finished their tutelage at Hogwarts.There's much to be learned here too--and not just for the millions of underage Potter fans.  Characters in Order of the Phoenix wrestle with frustration, anxiety, injustice and human frailty to a greater extent than Rowling has so far explored.  They don't always respond in constructive ways, and they don't always triumph. Whether you are reading this as a family or on your own, it may lead you to examine your own responses to such issues as injustice, disillusionment, frustration, anger--and heaven knows, we can all profit from a bit of self-examination.Character and plot development is quite a bit thicker in Order of the Phoenix , and you'll have to pay a bit of close attention to who's who and who's where and why if you want to keep up with the plot twists, but it provides wonderful opportunities for the story to keep spinning through the next two installments.I was (as I always am) sad when summer break began.  And I'm sadder still that I have to wait for the next one to find out how Harry and the rest fared on their exams. :)  Hope the sixth installment doesn't take as long to arrive as Order of the Pheonix did!All in all, Rowling is brilliant, really, and I never tire of her characters.  I suppose I'll just have to start over from Sorcerer's Stone and read them through again while I wait! Enjoy!cheers,Tamara",FALSE,2003,1469
"5036",4,731891,FALSE,"... although admittedly, I haven't read a whole ton of English children's books (English is not my first language). However, I've greatly enjoyed the HP series for its light-heartedness, childish humor, quirky & dorky but lovable characters, and fantastic setting. Deep down inside I think we all wished that we went to a school like Hogwart's. I don't know about actually living in the world of the wizards, but a Hogwart's ""education?"" Definitely.The main reason for this review is that I just wanted to point out that readers who are blasting Rowling's ""originality"" and claiming that she ""lifted"" stories from other cultures or works need to really calm down. Not to be blasphemous, but the Bible's stories are not entirely ""original,"" either, you can find traces of many earlier stories in it. And those earlier stories are probably based on still earlier ones. A book doesn't need to be completely original to be entertaining, and in this case, Rowling's characters, dialogue, and sense of humor more than make up for any supposed ""unoriginality."" Not to mention things like Cerberus are _meant_ to be recognized as references to other stories, or at least I am pretty sure of that ... if my dog had 3 heads, I would name it Cerberus ;)Overall, the series is turning much much darker, and I do agree that Harry is not nearly as likeable as before. But Rowling is a meticulous writer, and I assume that there is a point to all of this angst and discontent. The most important thing to realize is that this is part of a series after all, and while each book can be judged individually, their final score should also include how well they serve the entire series, and until the 7th book comes out, I think it is better to reserve some room for future judgment.",FALSE,2005,2170
"5037",4,731180,FALSE,"It's been three long years since The Goblet of Fire, and I was taken by surprise when I heard that the Order of the Phoenix was coming out.  Quite frankly I'd forgotten the series.  However, since book 4 I have been reading some significantly more advanced books, so this release gave me a nice break from what can sometimes be quite tedious reading material.  Of course, when I bought the book I dove right in and started reading so fast I completely lost track of what page I was on.  I was rather taken aback when I realized Harry's character had changed significantly.  He was no longer the virtuous little boy that I remembered from the Goblet of Fire, in fact, when he was talking about looking for trouble with Dudley and his friends, I thought to myself, ""I don't remember this...""  I suppose one could say that he is finally acting like a teenager, but I think the change was quite unsupported by the previous books.  Maybe I just don't remember them, but Harry's bitter attitude started to [upset] me off after a while.Aside from Harry being a bit annoying, the story was as lush as ever, and I found the length to be not any problem at all, as some have complained otherwise.  Some people may just want the book to skip directly to the action, but I think that would be a waste. After all, my favorite elements of these books, I've found, have been the descriptions of the situations in the common room and the rest of Hogwarts.  Another thing is that I was surprised at how stupid Harry is about girls.  He seems to speak way to honestly or harshly with them, or the one's he likes, that is, when he speaks at all.  I didn't find anything too weird about Cho... in fact, she acts more realistically then most of the other characters.Another note is that it's too bad she came out and said someone was going to die, and that they were important to the story.  It kept me constantly on the look out for possible candidates, which is not something you're supposed to be doing in a book like this.  Though the magical world Rowling has created here is quite realistic, there are many loopholes that I can see.  Honestly... middle school students cuss a lot more than Harry and his pals, unless git is supposed to be dirty or something.  I guess there will just never be a land as seemless and real as Tolkien's Middle Earth.

This is not a particularly memorable book as some parts seem to drag on forever and the few moments of enjoyable action in the book are few and far between. The character of Dolores Umbridge is detestable to say the least yet she seems to lack the sense of depth that I have come to expect from Rowling's characters such as Snape and Dumbledore. While some characters are changed beyond recognition at times the teachers suddenly develop personalities which give them real individualism and it must be said that this is definitely for the better and possibly the only thing that drags the rating up to an entire three stars.The conflict we have come to expect from the books has moved from everyone against Voldemort to Hogwarts versus the ignorant, blind fools at the Ministry and Voldemort, though these two are by no means allied.

I will not give away the identity of this character, but must mention that it is a surprise. I'm sure that very few people would guess who will be lost. It is quite sudden and painful. This is truly great drama.More than ever, Rowling's ability to mix both the extraordinary and epic drama, with the very relatable coming of age angst of growing up is superb. We don't doubt that Harry would really be concerned about a girl despite all that is going on. It is a beautiful balance. Also, in Order of the Phoenix, we have the first true wizard battle. It is exhilirating to have such a large scale and fast paced fight involving such a large number of wizards. Truly spellbinding.We are also treated to some wonderful new characters (Luna Lovegood, Nymphadora Tonks, and Professor Umbridge stand out) and visits from some old ones.

I think  its plot has considerably more emotional weight.  It's not just a  pleasantly exciting story; it deals with issues of trust and friendship  that make you feel and think as you read.The basic premise of the book  is simple: Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban, and is  on the loose, looking for Harry.  Adventures ensue.  A wonderful character  (perhaps my favorite in the series to date), Professor Remus Lupin, joins  the Hogwarts cast.

And ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is, confirming all hopes and expectations, quite the most brilliant, mature, and *tragic* adventure yet.Harry is in his fifth year at wizarding school and has much more than his OWLS exams to worry about. The Ministry of Magic is stubbornly denying Lord Voldemort's return, and doing its utmost to discredit the names of both Harry and the Headmaster Dumbledore and make them objects of ridicule and incredulity - with not a little success. The sanctuary of Hogwarts is violated by Professor Umbridge, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who also happens to be the Ministry's representative; and with its authorisation, she carries out an Inquisition within the school. No student or teacher is safe. Professor Umbridge tops even Snape for pure spite. Meanwhile numerous Death Eaters have escaped from Akzaban to join their master, and Harry starts to have disquietening visions in which HE is Voldemort.J. K. Rowlings has never shrinked from showing her characters as anything but flawed and complex. Harry, at fifteen, is now a teenager, and frustrated that he is still being treated as a child. His moments of angst and rebelliousness ring true. The author's heroes are not lily-white and perfect, and Harry during the course of this book learns some things about his beloved parents and godfather Sirius Black that tarnishes the image he'd held of them and makes him almost sympathetic towards Snape. Even Dumbledore is proved to be fallible. By the end of the book, Harry will have experienced as much of the pain and hypocricy of the world as any adult - and yes, a main character does die, and I won't say which, only that if you're anything like me, you will cry - but he has still more burdens to bear.

Although daunting in size, book 5 in the wonderful Harry Potter series is an easy read--between Rowling's easy-going style and intruiging plot, you won't want to put it down.The Order of the Phonix, while longer than book 4 (Goblet of Fire), it doesn't drag or dwell too much on events not really central to the plot.  You will need to have read all four of the previous books to really understand everything that is going on--Rowling spends almost no time explaining things found in other books.Beware, however.  This book is much darker than any yet--it is truly a battle between good and evil (and indifference).  As if to drive home evil nature of Voldemort, we watch as another character dies in this one; this time its one who we have come to know through the previous books.All in all, a great read.  Highly recommended for Muggles and Wizards alike.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5058",5,731196,FALSE,"In the last four books Harry was saving people, risking his neck etc.  Now in this book everything isn't so peachy for him, people think it is a bit odd that one boy could be involved in so many feats.  I think J.K. Rowling did a very good job of portraying the type of feelings that Harry should be feeling after losing a classmate from the previous year.  I really liked that we got to know the other characters that weren't in Harry's gang. This book is the best in the series when it comes to illicting feelings like rage, hate, sympathy, pain, etc.  I'm sure most students can relate to Harry and the way Mrs. Umbridge treats him and the other students.  As students they felt powerless to stop Mrs. Umbridge. I really felt the dislike that was simmering in all the characters regarding Mrs. Umbridge. All in all after the third book in the series this one is my second favorite.",FALSE,2003,1475
"5059",5,731188,FALSE,"I got the book today and read bits and pieces until I could sit down and read the whole thing through.It's both brilliant and heartbreaking. Mrs. Rowling has written another masterpiece and this was definitely worth the wait. Minor characters from previous books have much larger parts and those who you disliked in the GoF you will despise now. With some exceptions, of course. There are dozens of new places Harry and his friends go to and I can't say too much without spoiling it, but you will not regret buying this.Also, keep tissues nearby. If you love these characters, you'll cry as much as I did when you reach the end. It's heartbreaking, but if it hadn't happened, the books would be as flat as the other books in a children's department. To parents, be wary that it's a depressing ending, albeit some humour. On a normal basis, I'd kick myself for warning you, but if your kids really love these characters, then they're going to be sad. I was crying for a solid twenty minutes during and after and I've been on and off since.It's true what people are saying when they say that Harry is angrier. He's very emotional in this book and greatly distressed that so many secrets are being kept hidden from him. He takes his chances though and does many things to show the bravery and courage within him, leading his friends to take a stand for what's right.It's a very different book, but it's still amazing.

"5060",4,731194,FALSE,"*SPOILERS*First, let me ask a question: did you ever want Harry to grow up a little? Well, he did. And not just a little. Many parts of this book is filled with teenage angst. Harry is no longer the giving and lovable boy anymore. Now he's either exploding with anger all over the place or brooding in a corner. It works IMO, but some people may have been frustrated with Harry for much of the story.Also, did you ever expect to find a professor that Harry hates even more than Snape? That happens too. Prof. Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is truly twisted. She's probably one of the high points in this book. It's impossible to not hate her.But the ending: Did you ever think that Dumbledore would tell EVERYTHING to Harry? I didn't, and while I usually like unexpected twists in th plot, this just seemed too random. It felt to me that the ""prophecy"" was just a gimmick to let J. K. Rowling finish the book. It would be a pretty good ending for many people, but I felt that the other endings were better. Also, some parts feel rather rushed, that is, for a Harry Potter book. They could have been developed into something more interesting.Because of Harry's teenage angst, the series takes a big turn in style, making the whole book much more ironic and dry when compared to the previous releases. I think it's a nice touch.This is a [dang] good book. Probably better than the past four. The reason I took off one star is because it still could have been so much more.",FALSE,2003,1473

But in my opinion, it never gets to the point of being annoying. Some people complain about it, but I say that it is necessary, in order to continue showing that Harry is changing with each book, and is going through new things that alter his personality.In this book, we get described to us what the Ministry of Magic is like, and Harry makes two visits there; both times are exciting to read about, and I could scarcely put the book down. A new character worth remembering is a well-liked one among fans. Luna Lovegood. Whether you love her, or love to hate her, she is definitely a character that keeps the story interesting when it threatens to lag.My only real complaint, is that this book could have used some editing. It is a little too long, and a little too drawn out. There are probably a couple of chapters that could be left out altogether, for that matter.Join Harry, Ron, and Hermione, on their greatest journey to date.

"5062",4,731189,FALSE,"The first word that comes to mind when comparing Harry Potter #5 with its predecessors? Different. Apart from being a darker and scarier tale than the others, we see a lot of changes within the characters themselves (such as Harry, who at 15 gets obnoxiously moody at times), some of which are unexpected but believable, and others that just don't seem possible. Percy Weasley, for example, transforms from a pompous-yet-lovable stickler for rules into a highly ambitious and ruthless wizard reminiscent of the elder Bartemius Crouch. Cornelius Fudge is equally disapponting.  Also unlike the previous novels, #5 can be split into two parts: the first 150 pages and the last 720. I found it very difficult to get immersed in the story during the beginning, which contained several forgettable incidents and seemed to be floundering until chapter nine. At that point, the novel regained the quiet charm and frequent comic relief that made Rowling successful and began to read like the previous four novels, quickly catching my attention (it kept me awake almost all night long, trying to finish) and holding it. The first part deserves a rating of 2 1/2 or 3 stars, and the second deserves all five.  #5 also recognizes Harry's 5th year as a pivotal year in his life and growth. Cho Chang returns, and there are several more hints that Ron and Hermione are perfect for one another. Harry also receives his first major experience of jealousy (I won't spoil it for you) and learns more about his parents' as well as his own past. There is a lot more character development, adding complexity to the once-flat personalities of people, including Professors Snape and Dumbledore, and James Potter. Even Fred and George are not always lighthearted.  Overall, I would definitely recommend #5 to any Potter fan - besides a lot of insight into the inner world of the characters, it's a wonderfully exciting and complex story, and long enough to be thoroughly satisfying.

"5068",5,731191,FALSE,"It's hard to write about the 5th installment of the Harry Potter series without resorting to spoiling some of the most affecting and emotional parts of the book.  Be that as it may, I will try to do the text the justice that it deserves.In OotP, Harry Potter is a different person than he was in the previous four books.  He's much more angry, and much more aggressive--but, then again, he's fifteen.  The book starts off with a blast of action bringing the Dursleys closer than ever to the wizarding world, and hardly takes the time to catch its breath.  The introduction of a new foe, one with the power to make the lives of everybody at Hogwart's miserable, keeps the reader on her toes and gives a sense of a world that's falling apart under a conspiracy of lies, and that can only be saved by those who know the truth.  Unlike GoF, the book stays together in a cohesive manner, and doesn't feel at all disjointed or overlong, despite actually having more pages and chapters.Additionally, many characters return for the fifth installment in the series.  People who were only mentioned in passing in books one and two are expanded upon and given lives of their own.  Also, we meet more Hogwarts students, and learn more about the ones we've already been introduced to.  Those characters that we've already grown familiar with also surprise us; Fred and George Weasley in particular are fantastic in this book, as are Ginny, Ron, and Neville.  We also gain an insight into Snape's past and his character, giving him yet another dimension.A warning, though, to those who would read this book; keep Kleenex nearby.  There are many parts of the book that are very emotional.  The series isn't strictly a children's series anymore; it's growing darker and more complex.  This makes this book more suitable for adults than the previous four, but still a great read for children.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5070",4,731189,FALSE,"This is the fifth book in JK Rowling's Harry Potter series, and is definitely the darkest of the lot.  We open with Harry at the Dursley's, waiting for any news from the magical world that may have made it to the muggle world, of Lord Voldemort's return.  At 15 years old, Harry is often an 'angry young man', frustrated with yet another summer living at his Uncle's, with limited contact from his best friends.  He has been left out of the loop, and to say the least, the frustration is evident.JK Rowling has again however, created a very readable story - filled with intrigue and injustice, and some good new characters and sub-plots.  She has also, notably, expanded some of the characters we know with more personality, depth and empathy.  (Neville Longbottom keeps getting more and more likeable).At 766 pages, the length of this book may put some off, but the story should be enough to keep you going. Don't be too excited to finally read the passage that has been widely used to promote the book where Dumbledore decides to tell Harry ""everything"", as this was one point in the book where perhaps the reality was less fantastic than expected.  Overall though, this book was a really good read, and a great installment in the Harry Potter series, yet possibly, not as enjoyable as book 4.  I would highly recommend this book to fans (as if they won't read it anyway), though I think some younger readers may struggle with the length, and the often dark and depressing content.",FALSE,2003,1468
"5072",5,731561,FALSE,"Hello Everyone,This, in my opinion, was the absolute best Harry Potter book of the series yet!I can't believe some of the reviews people are writing.  If you're one of those people who wrote bad reviews for this book then im guessing you either had made up your own vision of what this book was going to be about(a very bad idea) and were dissapointed, or you have not yet gone through puberty. There are exceptions to this of course.  I think that J.K. Rowling captured what so many teenagers go through on our journey to adulthood and that is not any easy thing to do. Of course most teenagers don't have powerful wizards trying to kill you but hey we've all got our problems and Harry tried to deal with his using anger and depression which I personally did at his age as well so I was pleased to see a bit of myself in him in this book.  Yes, this was a very darkly emotional book but honestly how would you feel if every year you went back to school there was some new evil plot to kill you when all you want is to hang out with your friends and gain the courage to talk to your crush.  And besides I think we all be a little ticked off if Umbridge came to our schools or the one pace we felt truly happy was changed into a place you wanted to escape from.  Anyway as you can tell i was a little ticked at things some(emphasize some)people were saying just because they do not have the emotional capacity to deal with the material in this book.All in All i applaude J.K.

"5075",4,731207,FALSE,"This review I am writing is mainly because I do not agree with some of the reviewers that this book dragged on, was depressing, had no depth to it and was a complete waste of time.Now everyone has a right to their opinion but it seems to me that some of those reviewers find it hard to deal with the dissapointment they felt because The Order of the Phoenix (TOOTP)did not live up to their expectations of Harry becoming even more powerful, less frightened or in constant battle with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.In The Order of the Phoenix we see the internal struggles of Harry; i.e. his frustrations, his anger and dissapointments. All very naturally considering what he went through in his previous year at Hogwarts. More extreme so than in normal kids? Yes, maybe, but then Harry is not average is he? Harry and many other main characters are very well developed and for the most very believable. The reason that I rated this installment with 4 and not 5 stars is that I have to agree with many reviewers here that the depth (so well depicted in the other teachers) is somewhat lacking in the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher. I would not be bothered by that much if this person had not such a vast role. A little more depth would have made this person just a bit more believable.The climax is however one that will excite most of its readers and though it might not be the clash that many hope it is again far more believeable than some superhero smash-him-up battle as some people clearly wanted it to be.All in all the world in TOOTP is feeling yet again the darkness rising and that can no longer be ignored, although some try very hard.So pick up TOOTP if you enjoyed the first four installments and don't be bothered by one star reviews until you've judged for yourself.Ganoes",FALSE,2003,1486
"5082",5,731237,FALSE,"In reading other reviews, I've been noticing dislike, and sometimes outright hostility directed towards this book. I get the feeling that much of this ""hostility"" comes from the fact that it is a much darker addition to the HP series than the other books. WHile some may say that this detracts from the quality of the book, I feel that it makes this the most genuine of all the books. The world is not always the cheerful happy place that far too many fantasy novels seem to want to depict these days. Death is always present in our world, and this is one of the few books that actually adresses that concept. Others seem to be convinced that the lenght of the book makes it bad, using the idea of ""quality, not quantity."" Try telling that to JRR Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings is over 1000 pages in its totallity, but funnny, I hear far fewer complaints there. This book is long because it needs to be long, and I don't feel there is any ""wasted space"" in the novel.No, this book does not have the innocence of the first three books (the fourth one didn't either, again, where are the complaints?) but adolescent life rarely has the innocence of late childhood. By refelcting these chainging values and being unafraid to pander solely to an audience of children, I believe thet Ms. Rowling has proved, more than anything else, that Harry Potter is not just some kids fad, and that she can hack it as an author.Read it all the way before you judge it.

"5085",5,731191,FALSE,"This is honestly the best book that I have ever read.  I'm an English major in college, getting ready to write my thesis, and I wish I could change my topic to Harry Potter!This book exists on so many levels that you could analyze it for years.  But, suffice it to say, you will not want to put it down.  The ending is phenomenal - another reviewer said that the ending was lackluster.  I have no idea what book he read, because I read the entire last 300 pages all the way through, unable to put it down (despite the fact that I had a final exam the next day.)  There's a showdown at the ministry of magic - I won't give away more than that.One other note: this book is never going to be any good in the movies; there's no way they can replicate on screen the emotion of which this book is full (remember in book 2 how Harry was really under suspicion at Hogwarts and was really alienated, but it hardly came out at all in the film?)  Well, this book is full of interior monologue and personal emotion...you really just have to read it.Rowling must have an obsession with vomiting, because someone vomits about every 10 pages.

It is also creepier, though comic relief, as always, is scattered throughout.  My only complaint is that Harry can be sullen and angry, which got annoying after a while, but as he is a teenager, it is age appropiate.  The new characters are interesting and well drawn, the plotting is dead on, and as I finished it, I found myself wishing it was a bit longer.

"5088",5,731191,FALSE,"I have been a huge fan of The Harry Potter books for a few years now, and I was positive that Book 5 could not possibly live up to my lofty expectations.  I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  There is no way for me to do this book justice.One thing I have admired most about J.K. Rowling is her ability to move and grow with her main audience.  While everyone under the sun loves the Potter books, J.K. started writing them for young teens.  Impressively, every consecutive book has become larger in both page count and scope, growing with its core audience.  There is much more here for an older audience and the natural progression in tone and length is what has kept the Potter books at the top of my list as one of the greatest book series I have ever read.  And at a hefty 870 pages, Book 5 has not only beefed up the size, it has also turned Harry's upside down in amazingly epic fashion.  Harry acts just like the moody 15 year old he is and the author is not afraid of letting her audience second guess Harry, even dislike him at times (briefly, don't worry).  Ron and Hermione are given even more time in the book, further expanding on two already deep, fascinating characters.  Even Neville Longbottom shines here, and someone who has been following the books from the beginning will probably feel proud of him, as odd as that may sound.This is the best Harry Potter book so far.  It is also the darkest.  While it is not all doom and gloom, there is a real sense of horror and dread permiating throughout as well as a few truly tragic moments.  Harry's life has never been this hard, and this makes his high points that much more exciting for the reader.J.K. Rowling has done another outstanding job here.  The rich story she continues to unravel keeps amazing me with its intelligence and true emotion.  And hell, any writer that can get kids to read has to be doing something right.This is the best book in the series.  I cannot stress this enough.

"5089",5,731266,FALSE,"Anyone who is reading this well knows that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was one of the most fresh and welcome books the world of literature had seen in quite awhile.  How wonderful it was for readers to be transported to this magical place called Hogwarts that was hidden from all of us muggles as they like to call us.  The formula for success was obvious.  An extremely suspenseful and entertaining story and just as important, the establishment of a very likeable character.  I myself was one of the millions who were pleasently surprised and well entertained by the original novel. Then along came the second novel, The Chamber of Secrets.  When I finished this one, one word instantly flashed in my brain...disappointment.  Some of you reading this may disagree with that statement and you are certainly welcome to but I just felt that it did little to advance the story.  It was basically the same exact structure as the first novel.  Harry at the Dursleys', arrives at Hogwarts, something causes trouble, Harry and friends investigate, discover evil Voldemort, battle Voldemort and win, happy ending and throw in a quidditch match or two somewhere in between.  Despite all this, Chamber of Secrets remained somewhat entertaining, which brings me to the third installment, Prisoner of Azkaban.  For me, this was either going to ruin the series or get it back on track and I'm proud to say it was the latter. This novel is by far the best book in the series up to this point.  Although it still largely follows the formula I mentioned in the last paragraph, there are some important exceptions that make this book so great. First, we get much more background information on a lot more characters, many of which are newly introduced.  Whereas Chamber of Secrets seemed to only give us background info on Lord Voldemort and Hagrid, Prisoner of Azkaban goes much further, delving quite deeply into past events involving Harry's Parents and their group of friends, Harry's godfather, Professor Snape, as well as the villain of the novel.  All of their stories are well connected.  A showcase for Rowling's skill as a writer. Speaking of the villain, the main nemesis this time around is someone other than Lord Voldemort.  Although he is still mentioned countless times, there is no epic confrontation.  One could argue that this was a risky move but is a wise one in my opinion.  By keeping Voldemort somewhat out of the picture, not only did it add some much needed variety but also prevented the clash between him and Harry from potentially losing its luster as far as readers are concerned.  This way, whenever Rowling decides to bring him back in a future installment, the stakes will be much higher and hopefully readers will be more interested in the battle between the two than ever before. Another thing that I will mention is that this novel includes considerably more Quidditch action than the previous two books.  The reader actually gets to see an entire season of it unfold before their eyes as they read the novel.  Fans (including myself) seem to love the quidditch scenes and those who were hoping for more of it will be extremely satisfied. I'll finish by reinstating that Prisoner of Azkaban is a better novel than the first two.  I can't emphasize enough how much better it is than Chamber of Secrets.  I still have to read the next two books.  Hopefully they will be even better than this one although that will be tough.  Any Harry Potter fan should get this book if they haven't done so already.  I also encourage anyone who has yet to experience Harry Potter to give it a try as it is quickly becoming one of the truly great literary series in recent times.",FALSE,2003,1545

I thoroughly enjoyed the first four books in the series and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. Now that I've read the book I am really ambiguous about it. On the one hand it was a fun book and enjoyable to read and on the other hand it seems like it was just filler. Nothing happened. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of action in the book and the adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were just as enjoyable as the first four books. There is also the expanded universe in that you find out what it's like at a wizards hospital and the Ministry of Magic. Professor Snape gets fleshed out a little and there are a few major changes for the Weasleys and Sirius Black. But the basic plot at the end is basically in the same spot it was at the end of The Goblet of Fire. It's really frustrating.My recommendation?

This, my friends, is your classic middle series book. it lacks a true begining and end, and really doesn't make any new definaitions in ther series, it is just telling a story that is incomplete, for it has not happend yet. such books as the subtle knife, and the two towers also had the same fate, but this book has other problems that seperate it from any other middle series books, and that is the length...  I was thrilled to see rowling had written a whoping 870 pages, because after the amazing goblet of fire, i figured that she was an author who operated better with more pages, adn the ability to give readers time to adjust, but i find myself in-correct, as i realize there is about enough content in this book, to last only a lucky 400 pages, which makes one wonder what she does with the other 470 in the book that i claim non exsistant story. well it's her doing several things...- turning harry into my 3 year old after breaking into the candy drawer- turning cho chang into an emotional crying mess- elimantating some charecters completely from the story in order to make room for much more boring, less interesting ones- giving harry fits of rage- turning sirius into a semi-hateful person- more tantrums- hermione turns into harrys love doctor- harry cries some more- etc...

The book basically starts out with Harry at his aunt and uncles house, when he decides to go out for a walk. He spies dudley and his ""gang"" beating up a child. Dudley leaves the area. Harry was taunting him as they walked. While they were walking down the street, they were attacked. Harry went home carrying dudley, stiff as a board. When he got home, there were owls flying in, from Mr.Weasly, the ministry of magic sending him to a discplinary hearing, and a howler, which made harrys relatives let him stay after telling him to leave. After a few days, Harry is bailed out, by the Advance Gaurd. Harry learns about the Order of The Phoenix and is astonished how it was his godfathers house. Harry then goes to the hearing and he is defended by Dumbledore, and he is successful in the hearing. Harry goes back to school. He learns about his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and learns that the ministry is trying to interfere with Hogwarts. Harrys dreams about a door are coming more into focus after many dreams that failed. As the school year goes on, many things happen. Ron on the Quidditch team, Hagrids return, Detention for Harry, and becoming a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry goes off to the ministry after seeing a vision of Sirius being hurt. He runs down to the ministry and tries to save Sirius, but instead of finding him, he found Voldermort.I liked this book because of the excellent plotline of events and how there was the Order of the Phoenix. I liked the great figurative speech because it helped me understand what they were trying to say better, ""I know, but would you please stop trying to bite off my head"".I also disliked this book because the part where Harry just develops a newfound power makes no sense. I also disliked this book because of how Harry got a bad temper after one summer. ""Take this to Ron and Hermione and make them give me longer letters, or peck their fingers"" was a quote i didnt exactly understan.dMy favorite part of this book was the epic battle in the ministry of magic. Where Harry fought the death eaters with his friends and how Voldermort was defeated again by Dumbledore. The part which i hated about this book was how Harry kept getting detention just for telling the truth which made no sense to me.

The book seemed to lack direction. It was as if I just read 500 pages of pure exposition. I was reading filler!And the death of a major character (I won't specify) was a waste. Neither heroic or required, it rang both false and useless.I am no editor, but this book screams for a good one. I suspect it could have been editted down by a couple of hundred pages and been as good or better than some of the earlier novels. The ideas are apparent. They are not well developed or executed.",FALSE,2003,1469
"5107",3,731213,FALSE,"Well, I have to say I had become quite a fan of Harry Potter before it had gotten really big and I just couldn't stop reading hte books. The movies just really aren't that great due to the fact they jump to the important parts but leave the fun scenes out. However, my favorite book from the start is part 3. After reading so far into Harry Potter I couldn't wait for the 5th book to come out and now I am awfully upset I waisted so much energy waiting for it. The plot was horrible, Harry has become a spoiled rotten brat with whom I kept wishing to die because of how rude and mean he has become in this book, and this book was chock full of useless information. I mean, J. K. Rowling really could have cut this book down to maybe 20 chapters and that's pushing it. The only really entertaining part was when Voldemort came back and was going to fight Harry. Plus, I believe all of us fans knew that Harry was going to have to fight Voldemort in the end no matter what. I gave this book three stars because I enjoyed how much she detailed Umbridge and how she made us all hate her so much. I think she had to be the very best part about the book. All of the rest was basically just babble and we really could have done without all of the dancing around what she was trying to explain.

Before the first chapter is over, Harry and his ignorant cousin Dudley are attacked by Lord Voldemort's dementors, and the action continues on a fast pace. The drama seems heightened by Harry's teenaged angst (when we were teens, everything was a drama, wasn't it?). Another plus, if you've followed the series, is finding out more about some of the more curious characters: Snape. James Potter. The bumbling Neville and what happened to his parents. At the center remains the friendship among Harry, Hermione, and Ron, though their bonds are tested to the straining point. The concluding chapters were too engrossing to put down, so keep an hour or two set aside once you get to chapter 33.",FALSE,2003,1461
"5109",5,731188,FALSE,"Wow! How beautiful! How magnificent! And I thought ""The Goblet of Fire"" topped all the Harry Potter books. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is amazing. When J.K. Rowling said that the next books would be ""darker,"" she definitely wasn't kidding, if this book is any indication. [There are *very* slight spoilers here, but I assure you that I have made sure that there is nothing to ruin your enjoyment of the story.]The action and humour are non-stop throughout the whole book. The Dark Lord on the rise, though many are determined to ignore the signs. The Ministry is almost corrupt, the Daily Prophet starts spouting more rumours than truth, and those in the know are trying desperately to prepare for the worst. The Death Eaters seem more sinister than ever. Without spoiling here, we get to learn about Sirius Black's family tree, find out why some people become ghosts while others don't, see James, Sirius, Remus, Lily, and Severus in their fifth year from the memories of someone actually there, and (here's the big one) FINALLY get to know why Voldemort wanted to kill baby Harry in the first place!Several new characters have been introduced, sporting uniquely delightful names (can you say ""Nymphadora Tonks""? How about ""Phineas Nigellus""?). Our heroes make a (sort-of) new friend in ""Luna Lovegood"", a somewhat batty girl who nevertheless proves herself helpful. Several exciting journeys take the group through the Forbidden Forest (yet again), deep into the Ministry of Magic, and to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies. The students, on top of everything, are preparing to take their O.W.L.s, and are worked harder than ever so that they may receive a passing grade. Teenage hormones start to rage as Harry finds himself drawn to the beautiful Cho Chang (look above! It's mistletoe!). Altogether, Harry is so overwhelmed with everything that it's no wonder he starts to come off as a bit anti-social . . . though he IS a teenager, so I can't quite blame him for his frayed emotional state.The new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor you'll hate more than Rita Skeeter, I guarantee it. She's positively vile, dishing out detentions that literally scar the victim, and performing inspections on the professors. Madness is wreaked upon Quidditch practices, Harry's dreams are tormented by visions of Voldemort, and even the teachers are rebelling against the flaws in the Ministry's system, which is determined to crack down on Dumbledore. (McGonagall is a true gem in the story.) Toss in a few disappearing houses and rooms, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, and more House Elf madness, and you'll find yourself teetering along the line of laughter and shock at some of the darker aspects of the plot. There are so many twists and turns, personality-wise, that you won't be able to believe (watch for Percy Weasley and the centaurs, notably).And yes, we all know that a character from the ""good"" side dies, though being courteous, of course, I'm not going to tell you who that person is.

"5110",5,731190,FALSE,"The weekend Harry Potter came out it rained and rained. Perfect excuse not to go out. Yes, what you have heard is true. This is longer and darker. Things happen that could be disturbing to the youngest of Harry's fans. But Harry is growing up. His enemies are growing more powerful and he's experiencing problems that all of us experience.All of this makes the tapestry richer and reading the story more rewarding. Harry and Ron and Hermione are growing up. They're becoming more independent and growing as individuals. It is this very thing that makes the book more enjoyable to read.As to the story, it is enough to say he who must not be named is trying to get something done and Harry will stop him. (If he didn't it wouldn't be much of a story.) There's more magic and Harry and others seem to know what they're doing as they use it rather than using magic in a haphazard way.Along the way, you're in for an enjoyable ride. Because the book is longer, we have more time to see many of the supporting characters. If you like Ron, you'll like what happens to him. He becomes a person in his own right. As does Neville. Hermione is as she always is, but she is no longer just a bratty know-it-all. If you want more plot details (but not too many), read the information from the publisher.If you're a fan, enjoy.

"5111",5,731188,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is to my mind the best Potter book yet, though this is of course a matter of taste.  The big change is the attitude of the series - Harry Potter's chief virtue in the first few books is that he's a nice, brave kid, able to appreciate the wonder of what's around him because he was raised in such deprived conditions.  Bad things would happen, but people would help him and he'd deal with it.  And there was a sense that everything that happened to him was yet another random benefit of his unusual birth - in short, the books were funny and entertaining, but they lacked real suspense because the protagonist seemed to be totally surrounded by several layers of deus ex machina.This book changes all that.Here, Harry Potter's birthright is his biggest problem - the scar on his forehead is endangering not only him but other people, the newspapers are calling him a glory-hound and a liar, his relationship with Dumbledore, through no fault of his own, becomes strained, and even his father, in whom he was ceaselessly proud up to this point, becomes a figure of suspicion.  In response to this, Harry starts to act like a typical teenager; he is whiny, self-important, quick to judge, and a pain to be around for Ron and Hermione, who are often more patient than he deserves.  Harry's previous good luck has given him a combination of arrogance (he gets angry when Ron beats him out at something) and fear of responsibility.  Ultimately, he wises up and takes responsibility for himself, taking a true leadership role for the first time, and the results are utterly tragic.There's something really nuanced at work in the way this book deals with failure and loss.  There's a scene early on in which Molly Weasley begins to cry as she realizes that her family will probably not survive the war with Voldemort intact, and that even so, even though she is terrified for her husband and children, she is going to fight.  The idea that the world of Harry Potter has changed, that every choice now has real consequences, is reinforced again and again this book, and the result is that Potter himself seems more human, his world more fragile.It's also nice to see Harry dating, but of course the more interesting relationsip, Ron and Hermione, has yet to go anywhere, and that's the one everybody's waiting for.  Maybe next book.In the meantime, there's lot's of everything one normally likes in a Harry Potter book - magic, laughs, Snape being nasty and cool all at once, Voldemort being evil, Hagrid being an idiot...the list could go on forever. This book is truer to the formula set by the first three books than Goblet of Fire was, but that actually proves to be an asset here. In short, if you haven't bought this book, do so right this second and read it immediately.  It's worth it.",FALSE,2003,1467
"5112",5,731480,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great book to read again and again and again. I have read it several times and I still can't put it down! The three things that were excellent in the book were the fact that it was the next book in the series, the visual imagery of the words, and the irony of it all. The one drawback was that the book started out slow. The fact that the book was the next in the series needs no elaboration. The descriptive words however, does.Read this quote direct from the book and try to tell me you can't see a picture in your mind: ""Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and reads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-colored beaks and a large, brilliantly orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking... Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black"".I could see the hippogriff jumping off the page when I first read that. These Harry Potter books have a history for being very ironic. Everyone who read the first book thought they had the hero pegged, but it turned to be the cowardly teacher, Professor Quirrell who was the culprit. Everyone who read the second book was looking at Gilderoy Lockhart, the sort of ironic answer, but an item they picked up along the way turned out to be cursed with powerful magic that was causing it all.At the beginning of this book, as Harry is on the Hogwarts Express, the train is ""attacked"" by dementors but it turns out that they were boarding the express to protect the school from a powerful wizard convicted of mass murder. This book isn't really a page turner from page 1, but give it a chance and you won't be disappointed. It also helps to read the first and second book in the series before reading this one. Most of the groundwork is lain in the first and second books in the series.",FALSE,2004,1759
"5113",4,731190,FALSE,"Like many avid Harry Potter fans, I scurried to the bookstore to purchase my reserved copy of The Order of the Phoenix. I was enthralled by the book despite a major setback; Harry himself was turning out to be quite an annoying character. Though Rowling does give some support and reasoning for why Harry gets on his soapbox from which he rants and raves, she does not give him enough support so that the reader can support him as well. He treats his friends like dirt when they have stood by his side, time and time again. Upon his arrival at Headquarters, he blasts Hermione and Ron for keeping their word to Dumbledore, though he is fully aware (or should be) that they would have told him, if they had a secure way of informing him of what had been happening. Harry himself made a promise to Dumbledore in not revealing the fates of Neville's parents, something he knew could be entrusted to his best friends, but is quick to judge his friends for acting the same. Then he really irritates the reader by demanding recognition for his enormous feats that he performed alone, which he later tries to discount and attribute to his friends when members of the yet-unformed D.A. try to convince him to teach them. He continually takes out his frustrations on Ron and Hermione, even though they eventually call him on it. Also, he selfishly thinks of only why he wasn't chosen as Prefect when both his best friends have, instead of celebrating their achievement. Again and again throughout the novel, he refuses to listen to anyone's advice, even coming from people who are continually proven right and right again, eventually leading to a character's demise. Hermione flat out points out his hero complex, but Harry's pride refuses to allow him to see the reason or logic of anything. Disheartened by knowledge that he learns about his father, he actually proves one point: he is as arrogant as his father. Harry could have been better explained, had better narration into his thoughts to make him seem not so childish and irritating, but Rowling chose not to do so. The plot itself was completely and constantly intriguing. I've never closed a Potter book feeling so satisfied. After each book, there are usually a few, ""That was great, but I wish I knew what happened to/about..."" but this time, there wasn't. As a reader, one knew resolutely that the good guys were happy (good luck to the Weasely twins), the bad guys got their comeuppance--partically Prof. Umbridge--and maybe Harry won't have such a horrible summer. Hopefully, Harry's character flaws had to be revealed so pointedly for upcoming plotlines in Books 6 & 7, but overall the Order of the Phoenix was still a great read.",FALSE,2003,1469
"5114",2,731492,FALSE,"First of all I'll simply say that this book is far, far, far too long. There is definitely not a lot of plot to sustain the 700+ pages and it is in need of some serious trimming down. There are many chapters that are just plain useless, sub-plots that are uninteresting and further no particular cause, and a distinct lack of anything really dramatic.If all the usual stuff was left out and the book focused only on Lord Voldemort's return then it would have been entertaining to read. But with such a plot why did JK Rowling feel the need to chuck in Quidditch matches (these are seriously getting boring, how many variations of Harry catching the snitch do we need?), Harry's boring problems with a girl he inexplicably likes, uninteresting points about homework and revision, a meaningless subplot involving Hagrid's brother, a pointless subplot involving Firenze the Centaur becoming a teacher, and Hermione's involvement with SPEW and all her knitting. If all this boring stuff was left out then we would have been left with a pretty fast-paced book. I'm sad to say though, this one really lets the whole series down.There are some new touches that are particularly effective however. A new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, called Professor Umbridge, is just about the most evil, twisted and horrible woman ever. Rowling's description of her perfectly describes absolute wickedness and malice. And it's also good to see Neville Longbottom get a chance to act the hero for once, he's always been a character I like.I hope the next book isn't as overlong and tedious as this. OOTP was a MAJOR let-down. I can only seriously recommend it to absolute HARDCORE fans. I mean if the first book made a 153 minute film and the second made a 160 minute film then OOTP would be a film lasting almost 9 HOURS!!!",FALSE,2004,1771

"5122",4,731192,FALSE,"I thought I'd spend the week luxuriating in this book but last night  I couldn't help myself and stayed up late finishing it.This book is a bit darker than the rest in the series.  You-Know-Who is back, and is becoming a threat not only to Harry but to the entire wizarding world as well.  And Harry (and Hermione and Ron) are all caught up in the throes of adolescence, which means they are moody and easily distracted by things like jealousy and longing.This book introduces the Order of the Phoenix, a secret magical society whose members don't always agree with each other on everything, but who can (for the most part) put their animosity aside to join forces against He-Whose-Name-Must-Not-Be-Spoken.  Many new characters appear, and surprising things are revealed about other characters.The gloominess of Harry's world begins to fall away halfway through the book, when people decide to start actively resisting the followers of What's-His-Name (as well as the disbelieving members of the general magical public, who seem to prefer dwelling  in a cozy state of denial until the truth is not so easily avoided).  I was almost starting to think Harry had lost his magic when I got to this point, as he was spending a lot of his time wandering in a state of emotional turmoil while snapping at his best friends (just like a real fifteen year old).  Fortunately the story began to pick up steam somewhere around the middle and I stayed up late to finish it.I love the way this magical universe expands laterally.  We learn more about the characters, we get to see the inside of places like the Ministry of Magic and St. Mungo's Hospital, and we find out much more about wizardly politics while still staying within the general framework of the previous books.Yes, Harry has his first kiss (as well as his first date).  And yes, a major character dies (not a main character, a major character).And yes, Harry eventually gets out of his moody teenage angst, which sparks resistance against the new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor and all the changes in Harry's world that have come with her.

I should also know this because the only reason I started to read Harry Potter was because my mom had bought them years ago, and I didnt want to let them go to waste. Also the idea of going on an airplane for a 5 hour flight from New York to California also persuaded me to read the books.  So I read all four books within I would say about a week and I didnt think that any book could be better. I do not see how anyone can say the ""classics"" that we have today are better than these books. Your so called ""classics"" are what turned me off from reading. For instance Frankenstein, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, and any book by Shakespeare. While these books increase your reading ability and vocabulary that is all they do. They do not bring you into a world where you can enjoy a book for what it really is supposed to be. The ""classics"" are ruining books for kids today, and maybe they should be assigning these books for children to read in about 6th -7th grade, and highschool teachers should strongly reccomend that highschool students read these so we know that not all books are horrible.  So as to my review for this book, it is an incredible book. It expands on everything that JK Rowling has previously written and makes you feel as if this world could somehow be co-existing with ours. It answers questions that have been present from the 1st book, which no one even remembered to even ask because of JK's understanding of how to trick people, and at the end of the book it leaves you with questions that you know will be answered in the next 2 books. All I can say is that I hope that JK Rowling continues to write in such a way that captures everyone's imagination and writes a story that keeps people coming back.

"5125",5,731190,FALSE,"Finally, after about a three year wait, the next installment in the Harry Potter 'Series' has arrived. If you have come to love and read these books attentively, you will notice that each book is very different than the rest. You can sum up the series as in saying the first three books were somewhat playful, still delving into the world of witches and wizards, but as we see in the end of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', this series has taken a dark turn, revealing the cowardice and bravery in peoples who were never usually turned to, kids.  This book turns away from the usual formula of Rowling's writing, there are nearly one-hundred-fifty pages that don't even mention Hogwarts, but of course, Ms. Rowling knows what she's doing. After a long exposition, which introduces us to the 'Order of the Phoenix' -- a society who fights againstVoldemort -- we finally return to Hogwarts, where all hell eventually breaks loose.  Hogwarts has fallen under the control of the inept Ministry of Magic. And as the 'Daily Prophet' keeps throwing pot-shots at Harry and Dumbledore, calling them crazy for saying that Voldemort has returned, it seems as though the Misistry of Magic knows what has happened and is trying to keep it secret. And the Ministry doesn't fall into good taste with the students when it is clear that they favor Slytherin over any other Hogwart's House  As the story continues, Harry discovers an un-natural bond between him and Voldemort. And the focus of Harry turns from school, to girls. Cho Chang, whom I am convinced, is a full-fledged sociopath, finally confronts Harry about their mounting romantic tension.  This is by far, my most favorite book in the series, just beating 'Goblet of Fire'. This book reveals the strength of children when they band together, who eventually set the Ministry of Magic straight. This book, agian, has great description, narrative words, setting, mood and of course, characters.  You just can't help being enchanted by these books, they are magical and appealing to all 'Muggles', adult and child.

Perhaps this was due to the fact that I was so enthralled that I stayed up until 5 in the morning to finish it and could not make heads or tails of anything. Or perhaps it was owing to the subtly, deftly and thickly layered plot--too much for my puny brain.I read it and tossed it aside, declaring it was my least favorite by far. Many agreed, claiming 'this is what happens when people make too much money at something'.Then I decided one day that I couldn't remember much of what I read, and so started to re-read the whole series. I re-read each book at least 2, if not 3 times, just so I wouldn't forget (yet I have). I grudgingly picked up book 5, knowing that book 6 was on the horizon, and being quite afraid that it too, would choke.To my amazing delight, it was an absolute charm. Unlike with books 2, 4 and 6, which all got more and more tedious with each read, I enjoyed it more and more. Thus far, my favorite of the series.Here's why:1. Character development: forget Harry's hormonally induced psychosis and the taint it places upon everything, just for a moment. Hermione, Ron, the twins and Umbridge were PRICELESS. Neville and Luna quickly became beloved. Dumbledore, despite his seeming diffidence, was brilliant. I have developed a weird fascination/fondness for Bellatrix--maybe her mommy didn't love her enough?2. unflinching...in the way it deals with emotion and pain. and terribly insightful in the same vein--particularly Hermione explaining Cho's waterworks.3. the DA--I wanted to join up, I admit. I wish the classes were still ongoing.4. Location, location, location. The whole Dept of Mysteries thing was GENIUS--'Accio Brain'...'nuff said. St. Mungo's was also a gem--very vivid. The whole Black family tapestry was sooo interesting...I wanted to know more.5. testing, testing, 123...I have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the O.W.L. part6. Wear layers! Like I said above, this was multilayered, as were the characters.7. 'the death'. it was almost cold. i felt like Harry was angry at Dumbledore not over that, actually, but more over the parent figure (i.e., D'dore) not 'being there' for him. and that was very interesting.

Joyful for us and Rowling, rather than Mr Potter and co, of course. Everything is satisfyingly there - and then some. Rowling spares no expense on the details - we could be at Hogwarts, in Gryffindor house with solid friends - and enemies! There are many surprises and wonderful jokes and tricks from the Weasley twins, magical gadgets, creatures, spells and classes - and a little love interest. Just a little - JK doesn't want Harry to have too much fun - obviously, since he's under age.If you have read any of the earlier books (and who hasn't now?), or seen any of the films, this is a deeply engrossing and satisfying read, until the somewhat flimsy ending - which is why it only gets 4 stars. We don't get to know Harry's OWL grades - surely those arrive before he leaves? And some of the mistakes - particularly in historical references (to other HP books!) are understandable in a tome of this thickness, but mean I'll just have to buy a later editiion.Summary; Essential reading (of course!), but flawed ending.

"5134",5,731190,FALSE,"It is so difficult to describe the power that this book has...As a fantasy and mystery writer Ms. Rowling's talent is indeed formidable, but her genius is in her sparkling and dynamic hero...  the 10 year-old Harry Potter from the first book has matured little by little each year and the writing has grown along with him.  The anxious-to-please wunderkid is now a disillusioned and angry teenager, beset by doubts and girls.  Having been 15 not too long ago, I can vouch for the accuracy of her depiction.  Certainly Harry is a much more realistic and understandable teenager than those shown in the repugnant ""teen movies"" that seem to be the accepted portrayal of high school life.In most books, especially in fantasy writing, we are told that a character feels a certain way, creating a rather detached situation... what makes Harry so beautiful is that Ms. Rowling's delightfully clear prose sweeps us straight into his essence and thus when Harry is upset we too are upset and when he is confused so too are we.The other major accomplishment of Ms. Rowling's is the creation of a consistent and detailed backdrop in which her story can take place.  This has done before, Tolkien and Le Guin come to mind, but once again Rowling has done it in a way that we can relate to.  Her world might not have the depth of Tolkien's (whose does?), but it is expanding with each additional book, and, most importantly, it is believable.  Aristotle once said that in drama an audience would accept ""the impossible but not the implausible"", a distinction that Harry's world verifies once again.Ultimately ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is by far the most sophisticated(until VI and VII of course) of a series that has accomplished the impossible in American society - unprecedented popularity without concession of artistic vision.  It helps that many of her original customers were young children(they are much more demanding about honesty than the general public), but her audience has now widely expanded as adults are dropping their self-importance and allowing themselves to be reminded that they too were once children.

She gets lost in what she is writing -- a kids book? a young readers book? an adult book that the young will like? -- developing her vocabulary yet neglecting her sentence complexity and stylistic grace -- she impertinantely uses words such as supercilious unnessisarily, and has yet to learn how to use a comma.  I think she is struggling to find her own voice as these kids grow up.  It is ever apperant that she is also struggling to find fresh plot points: she leaks spoilers such as, ""Someone in Harry's group is going to die,"" and then sets up scenarious that trick the reader into thinking that a this person is dead, only to find out that they were only asleep...ho-hum, so lame, so purile.

This book has a lot of detail in it, which I'm sure all Harry Potter fans will eat alive.

If you're looking for a light-hearted romp with some hints of evil, this is not the book for you.

The story of what happens when the Ministry of Magic attempts to take over Hogwarts, its control of the press (the Daily Prophet), and the attempt to scuttle a fair hearing for Harry at the beginning of the book, plus hundreds of other subtle turns, is a perfect picture of creeping fascism and how it takes over a society by dividing people against one another, by publishing lies and innuendo, by ""disappearing"" those who dissent, etc. I think Rowling depicted this brilliantly, while still maintaining her wonderful capturing of teenage angst caught in the middle of it all.

Though admittedly a grimmer experience than previous Hogwarts terms, the action will never-the-less leave you jubilantly breathless on the finish line, brain delirious with wizarding detail and anxious for more.J.K. continues to flesh out the expansive magical universe introduced and developed in her 4 previous works and tantalizes the reader with an array of creative concoctions every bit as sinister and complex as the potions brewed in Professor Snape's laboratory. The leading magi still manage to conjure believable turns of confused teenage reality while continuing to lead wholly fantastic lives. Meanwhile, the supporting cast of witches and warlocks (old and new) along with a ceaselessly imaginative variety of locales provide the ongoing saga with a host of wonderful subplots saturated in supernatural charisma.The story line moves right along, and if Hagrid seems a mite underdeveloped and Harry waxes a few pages too verbose with his mid-pubescent sulkiness I'm happy to forgive all with the hope that Book six will tie up those loose ends and present the faithful reader with a fresh Harry, a Harry greatly matured from another summer of lonesome cogitation, a Harry ready to meet the challenges that await him in his sixth year at Hogwarts and, eventually, a Harry well positioned to do you-know-what to you-know-who in Book 7.",FALSE,2003,1497

Though I am usually one to read ahead, I found myself resisting the tempation, as I wanted to savor each word.  Much of the angst of adolescence that tormented most of us is visited upon Harry in his fifth year at Hogwarts.  In addition, Harry is faced with the increasing presence of Lord Voldemort in a magical world that largely wants to exist in denial.  Many of the characters that were largely relegated to smaller roles in previous books come to life.  New characters are also introduced; some are quirky yet charming, others are truly treacherous.  The latest in the string of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers is a particularly annoying bureaucrat from the Ministry of Magic who regulates Hogwarts into mayhem.  Harry is also faced with the loss of a major character to further ""scar"" his already somewhat tragic life.  The magic of Harry, however, is his ability to find qualities and strength within himself to face the darkness in life.  He does not fail in this installment.  As a mother, I love that J.K.

Pre-teens who read this book will wonder where Harry has gotten all of this anger and question why he takes it out on everyone, page after page. After the slow start and considerable anger, Harry finally arrives at Hogwarts and the fun begins.Harry slowly resolves his anger and miraculously becomes the caring friend and courageous hero we all love from the previous books.  Rowling mixes in new interesting characters while giving us much less time with Hagrid and Dumbledore.  The most interesting parts revolve around Harry's crush on Cho and some very funny writing about the communication between boys and girls. While plenty of time was given to Hermione and Ron, I'd like to see them do more than just agree with Harry and stop worrying about getting him angry all the time.  The teachers in the book are again well-written with interesting revelations about Snape and Harry's dad which can be compared to Harry's ongoing anger with Malfoy.  The death scene of a ""major"" character is really not as sad as I think it could have been, but if you're like me you worried so much about who it might have been that it was almost anti-climactic when it happened.The excitement builds as Harry once again saves the wizarding world for yet another book.  (I somehow believe the wizarding world will forget his help and turn on him yet again). Rowling writes evil characters such as Snape, Voldemort and the Malfoys with such venom and passion that it is so fun to watch them fail, squirm or even be humiliated by a 15 year old wizard.The book is exciting and fun with twists, turns and new characters sprinkled throughout the book.

Sporadic mentions might add to the realism and detail, but the quanitity in this book get repetitive and downright annoying especially if you do not happen to empathize with Rowling's~~ interpretation. (though perhaps as a 19yr old, I cannot see my teenage years as clearly compared to Rowling's 20odd years of hindsight though she never raised teenagers). Another issue I have concerning this book is the unbelievable stupidity of the characters in the book. The actions of many main characters are unbelievably stupid and this includes the top minds in the wizarding world Dumbledore and Voldemort. For a while it seems that only Hermione has any brain at all. This made it difficult~~ for me to empathize with the characters as I did in previous books. Another problem I with this book is the lack of emotions. The supposed emotional scenes seem contrived and forced. Sometimes, the fight scenes reads like a movie: action without feeling. Other minor issues include a slow begining, not a very organized plot and a weak ending. The begining of the schoolyear was almost boring, the author did not weave her subplots as seamlessly as she did in previous books, and there was no shock~~ during or after the pivotal moment of the book.

There is a lot of extraneous material in this book - about a 100 pages cut out would not have hurt it - or rather would have helped it.The character of Dolores Umbridge is a particularly unsatisfactory aspect of this book. Hitherto, even Rowling's villains have had a redeeming quality - even Voldemort has a certain charisma. But Umbridge is merely a caricature of petty nastiness.On the flip side, the best part of the book is when the other similar character, Snape, who has till now never commanded the readers' sympathy (or Harry's, for that matter) becomes far more human in the chapter ""Snape's Worst Memory"". This chapter is the highlight of the book, for it turns Harry's definition of good and bad upside down. The father and his friends, whom Harry hero-worships, suddenly turn out to be spoilt brats and bullies, and Snape, whom Harry hates, just their undeserving victim.The worst part about the book is the plot - why is the prophecy so important, and why does Voldemort waste so much time and effort trying to get it? And why couldn't he simply get it himself? All he would need to do would be to apparate in the Ministry of Magic for a few seconds - simple enough if done at night.And what is the weapon that Sirius and Lupin mention at the beginning? It can't be the prophecy.The death of the character (I can't mention which character - spoiler!) is completely unwarranted and unnecessary.The climax is too long drawn out and complicated - and a huge let-down after the nail-biting graveyard scene in Goblet of Fire.The so-called secret revealed by Dumbledore is just as much of a let-down - it doesn't reveal anything that I hadn't already guessed, to an extent at least.Last, but not least, Hagrid (one of my favourite characters) does not have enough of a role in this book.After listing all these faults, you'll be wondering why I rated this book 5 stars not 1 or 2! But most of the faults are visible only when the book is compared to GOF or POA, not in itself. There were a number of things I enjoyed in OOP: learning about Sirius' life and family, learning more about the Ministry of Magic, Tonks, the real Mad-Eye Moody, Luna Lovegood, the DA, Harry's girl problems and disappointments, the Weasley twins' antics (always fun!), Ginny Weasley, the OWLs ... to name only a few! I also think Neville, Aunt Petunia and Hermione grew a lot as characters; Hermione especially because she lets Harry take command of the DA (after bullying him into it, of course!).

Cho Chang's swing of going out with Harry and other boy, along with Harry's mood swing, all indicated the author was on the good track, but failed in presumptuous and premature probes into today's teenager's mind.Like one of the reader expressed ""this book is just far too long. Several hundred pages could have been eliminated without skipping a beat.""I can see the start of the commercialization of the book series.  I will not be surprised to see Book 6 to have a thousand, if not more, pages long.",FALSE,2003,1476
"5189",5,731189,FALSE,"OoTP starts off with a bang and maintains momentum straight through to the end. There are many a surprise and unexpected revalation throughout the book, particularly as we get to meet new characters and learn more about the ones we have already met. Nearly everyone from the previous books makes an appearance, even though some of them are brief.As always, the characterizations are dead on, even when at first startling. After a moment or two, it all makes perfect sense. For example, the Ginny we thought we knew reveals new depth and subtlety and reminds us that, after all, she did grow up with seven older brothers. And many of the adults in Harry's life are revealed to be just as fallable as the rest of us. It isn't so much the development of characters and story as it is the expansion of Harry's worldview as he grows up.Through Harry, Rowling confronts some of society's attitudes towards the relationship between children and adults, crime and society, education and government, and the things we grow to take for granted. There are morals to the story, but never sermons, as Harry deals with the people and events in his life.I remember 15 years old and Rowling captures it well. The world is a harder and less forgiving place, and consequences come home to roost. And even the best of us make mistakes. Growing up, particularly if you are the prophesied David to Voldemort's Goliath, hurts but is as inevitable as breathing.I'm glad I bought the hardback and didn't wait for this to hit the library or borrow it from a friend. It was worth every penny and being up through the night to read it.",FALSE,2003,1468
"5190",5,731190,FALSE,"I got this book on the afternoon of 6-21. I could NOT put it DOWN! I am usually a fast reader, but not usually so fast that I can finish a book this size in 2 days! It is so enthralling that you feel as sucked into the story as Harry was in the Chamber of Secrets!!!This story is darker and edgier than the previous books. A lot of what was hinted in book 4 comes to pass in book 5, many mysteries that might have had you wondering in previous books will be revealed.  The story thunders along with the suspense of wondering when (and where) Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters will strike at Harry and those he cares about most deeply . As I said before the story is dark...unfortunately (for Harry) there are more low parts than high (but this makes for a good story).J.K. Rowling's writing is superb. She makes you feel as if these characters are your dearest friends and you cannot stop reading because you want to know exactly what is happening to them.Her imagination and use of description paints a picture of the story in your mind. After reading this book I feel like I have seen the movie...it is THAT vivid! Professor Umbridge is extremely frightful and I am so thankful that none of MY teachers had one of her quills for me to use when I had to write lines for punishment. You also will begin to understand better the reasons for Snape's treatment of Harry. Hogwarts will seem quite a different place from the Hogwarts of the previous books, but there is always a ray of light at the end of the tunnel. This is probably THE roughest time Harry has known in his life so you feel a lot for him during the story.",FALSE,2003,1469
"5191",5,731190,FALSE,"Ok, so this book met many expectations, but not all. Still a Big 5 stars, I mean who has the imagination to make all this stuff up in such great detail, with all it's consistency? It's just genius.  Ok so we knew someone was going to die...and I am glad it wasn't who I feared it to be...yet I thought it could have been written in a little less anticlimactic fashion, but I guess with all the suspense leading to this death, I expected blood to virtually pour from the pages of the book.  And I hate to see how dark and morbid these books are turning, with each one, it's 10X worse in the Order than the Goblet, which I again I know is only a natural way for the story to go, especially with all it's components, but I do wish for the Harry of old, way back in Sorcerer's Stone. I hope that in the 7th book things will be wrapped up in almost a circular path, back to the feelings of the first book.  [...]  I was pleased with the evolution of characters of Harry's friends at school as well, seeing more of Cho, Neville, and Ginny, with an addition of Luna. Also seeing the professors more closely, and the introduction of Death eaters in particular characters rather than an anonymous group.  I am very anxious for the next book (most likely will be waiting 4 years for next, I can read it when I am 25...) I hope that Voldemort will rise to a more powerful stance so we can learn more about him, more details of character and his past, as to how he became who he is at the present. I also hope that Harry doesn't do a 180 Ainiken Skywalker turn around and go insane/evil on everyone, because with everything he's been put through, book 5 highly suggests it for the last 2 volumes.  Book 5 is a page turner, and if you follow the series, have read all the rest of the books, well what are you waiting for? It does reveal many questions surrounding Harry and his connection to Voldemort, though more questions still arise from these answers...but if you've never read any of the books, start from the beginning and work your way, or it will make no sense, and this book is by far the darkest of the bunch and you won't catch the true magic from this one. Few complaints, though like I said it just seemed a tad bit anticlimactic, was hoping for a few more big suprises, such as who put Harry's name in the goblet of fire, who was searching for the stone, etc...this book was more predictable than the others. But again, has to have 5 stars because it's still an incredibly written book, and is understandable that the mood and many events in the book HAD to happen as they did, because that is how they are just meant to be, and disappointing or not, it wouldnt be the same any other way.",FALSE,2003,1469
"5195",3,731188,FALSE,"First of all, let me tell you that I am not a big HP fan.  I am a medium-sized one, if I may say so.  Nevertheless, I was very impatient to get the new volume in my hands.  For your information: I am not a ""fast"" reader: I read from 30 to 50 pages per hour.  It took me about 5 days with 6 hours per day to read the entire book.  My aim here is to explain what I think the author could have done better and how she could have done so.Second of all: the writing.  I have to admit that I couldn't put the book down.  It's true that I was on vacation and sick, so I hadn't a lot else to do, but the reading was very easy and enjoyable.  Some people complain that the writing level has risen and that the plot is too ""dark"".  I, for one, am pleased with this new turn since I am 16 and I find Rowling should write according to how she feels, and not aim at a particular age group.  My only reproach would be that the dialogs sometimes seem ""underdone"" -- meaning she (and/or the editor) should have worked on them more, because sometimes they just could have been better written (there are too many ""Er -- okay, right, yeah."" replies for one, and some other non ""er"" replies are lame); but this is a minor issue.  The last two chapters of the book also seem unfortunately to have been finished off too quickly.  The action is rushed and not very precise.  I don't mind reading 100 pages more, on the contrary: if they help the plot being exploited and written out correctly, fine!Thirdly, the plot.  I could not put the book down during my reading period, but once I had finished reading, I was somewhat disappointed; and this impression deepened as I read some bad customer review on this page.  The general development is okay, but I feel JK Rowling could have done better.  A good idea might have been to undertake less minor plots and stories and focus more on the big picture.  The Umbridge part is good, but I think the author could have exploited this character more & better: more secrecy, a ""darker"" profile etc might have rendered the new DADA teacher more intriguing and simply made her a more interesting character.  Instead she made her a power-seeking evil witch, which is good but not great.  The final chapters of the book could have been handled better too in my opinion.  The death of the major character is respectable since it is the author's choice and we readers must not forget that there are TWO more parts to be published -- so JK might have planned everything beautifully, and criticizing her unfinished work may prove to be foolish.  So let's accept the character's death gracefully.  The way in which the person dies is however lame: rushed, unrealistic, extremely anti-climatic ... even ridiculous!  Dumbledore's final explications too are not satisfying.  The final battle scenes should have been worked on more considering the 800 pages or so dedicated to the rest of the story, and Dumbledore's secrets should and, I think, easily could have been much more interesting.  Another disappointing thing is the lack of Quidditch games and hype in the book.  I find the part about Hagrid's tale is not very interesting either.  What he did may turn out to be important, but I think Ms. Rowling could have handled that part of the plot differently and made something better out of Hagrid's mysterious absence.  Harry's crush on Cho is a good idea, and I sincerely hope JK continues this realistic trend to develop Harry into a real teen, and not adapt to the children readers (the editor will publish adapted versions if necessary).  The O.W.L.s are another good idea.  The last remark I have here is that Rowling should have taken more time to examine the details of the plot (why didn't anybody --or everybody-- ask for Umbridge's resignation considering her outrageous behavior and greed for power?!  What are the checks and controls over Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge?  How is the M of M elected?  etc).All in all, I think Rowling should have included:1.More Quidditch games2.More mystery concerning Umbridge3.A better and more extensive final battle4.More interesting and revelatory secrets from Dumbledore at the end5.A better management of Minor and Major storylines (way too many pages about Mr. Weasley's attack, way too little in the last two chapters)The general turn of the events is okay with me, but I was somewhat disappointed by the serious lack of major action and plot development.Fourth of all, I think Harry's evolution is a good thing.  It is true, as have noted many customers here, that Harry shouts too much and is too dull.  This is understandable considering his situation, but it really doesn't make for pleasant reading.In general, I was not too disappointed by this new installment because the not so agreeable things about it are bound to evolve with the new installments: Harry's temperament for example will certainly change with his coming of age.  I am also sure that the minor lack of revelations and serious action in this book will also not be found in the volumes to come, since the plot is preparing us for ""bigger"" action (Rowling has decided to make this book a ""stage setting"" one, although many of us agree that even if seeking to do so, she could have done so in a slightly more ""active"" and ""fun"" way.  On a more positive note, it is important to underline the fact that Rowling writes in a very agreeable way. One should also insist on the fact that the magical world (Hogwarts especially) she created is fascinating, so the HP series is always fun to read.PS-- I have not the slightest intention to watch the HP movies.",FALSE,2003,1467
"5196",5,731191,FALSE,"I entered the wonderful wizarding world a little over a year ago, just before the first movie was released.  I had seen previews of the movie and they looked intriguing enough to check out the 1st book.  Well, 4 sleepless nights later on a Friday I had finished all four books, and my boss was ready to send me to the hospital for some unknown malady ( I couldn't exactly tell him I'd been up reading all week).I was a woman enthralled, for Harry Potter had put a spell on me.  The characters were amazingly complex and 3-dimensional, the plots were rich and interweaving, and I couldn't wait for the next one to come out.  For the HP books were and are NOT children books, they are books about growing up, and dealing with life.Waiting for the OotP to be released was insufferable, and I only had to wait a year and a half instead of three, but it was more than worth the wait.  In this book, gone is the wide eyed innocence of youth. No, HP is angry, pompous, edgy, confused, and he's not going to take it anymore.  In other words, he's 15.  Right from the beginning, the book starts with action, plot twists, intrigue, and drama, and doesn't end even when the book is over.....No longer the HP loving government, the MoM wants him wandless and discredited, for they are ABSOLUTELY unwilling to believe in Voldemort's return.  Harry comes before the court and we find out what pratts Fudge and Percy can be, while also meeting the malicious, vile, Delores Umbridge, who makes Snape look kind and generous.Here enters the OotP, working in secret for fear of punishment from the government against he-who-shall-not-be-named.  Returning favorites Snuffles (Sirius Black), Lupin, Mad-Eye-Moody, the Weasley's, and of course Dumbledore are all members.  It is here Harry is reunited with his friends Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasley children (sans Percy).  Harry discovers that Voldemort is after some secret weapon, but the order won't give him any specifics.Although sullen, he returns to Hogwarts with high hopes for the year.  Unfortunately, that Umbridge woman is the new DAD teacher.  She makes Harry's life a living torment.  Pretty soon she's all but taken over the school, and becomes a menace to everyone, teachers and students included, although Dumbledore does impede her with regularity.To make matters worse, this is the year that 5th years take their OWL's.  Every teacher has given them a colossal amount of homework in preparation.  In addition, his scar is hurting worse than ever and almost non-stop.  Plus, he's constantly dreaming about a long corridor with a blue light and a door at the end.  Unsure of its meaning, he doesn't know who to turn to for advice, for Dumbledore won't speak to him or even look at him.  He can't talk to Sirius as they are monitoring the Floo network and the owl post.  Malfoy and Snape are as delightful as ever.  Snape is, however shown in a new light, and we come to understand him a little better.The one thing guaranteed to alleviate Harry's anxiety, and what he likes to do above all else is taken from him.  In retaliation, the triumphant trio form the DA and recruit other students who believe in Voldemort's return and want to be prepared.  All of this leads to a climatic confrontation involving the MoM, OotP, Voldemorte & his Death Eaters, and the DA.It is here while protecting the weapon that Harry suffers a tragic loss that is at once poignant and heart rending, and which impact was barely covered and will definitely affect the two books to come.  It also brings about the revelation of why ole Tom Riddle tried to kill Harry as a baby and what will have to happen by the series conclusion.Without Ron or Hermione, I don't know how Harry would have made it through the year.  You can see how much they have grown over the last 4 years, and forged an unbreakable bond.  For the reader, you will definitely be grateful for the Weasley twins as they are a refreshing touch of levity in an otherwise emotional book.There is so much more that could be discussed, but I don't want to give too much away, and there just isn't enough space.  Many people are sure to mention this book is dark, and that is true, but with good reason.  JKR stays true to her characters and her story and the reader will appreciate it.  The only problem I have with this book is that it ended much too soon.  Nope, 780 pages just aren't enough.  I'm already feeling the effects of withdrawal from this imaginative masterpiece, and fear that the wait will prove to be as unbearable as Harry's 5th year.Ending on a happy note, I read an interview with JKR that said she has already started the 6th book!  Please let the words flow quickly.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5197",5,731190,FALSE,"I only got into the Harry Potter books after the first movie came out. My friends are both married and have a newborn child and we all went to the see the first movie together. Afterward, they could not believe that I had not read any of the books. Needless to say, they gave me the first book a few months later for Christmas. I read it and really enjoyed it much better than the movie and was amazed at how much the film left out and/or changed from the book.I finished the first book in one evening and was ready for more; unprepared for the urgent desire to read the second book, I ran out immediately and bought it. As it was a bit longer, it took me a few days of reading before going to bed to finish it. I was still dying to know what happened next, so the next weekend I bought the third book and finished it over a week or so. Then of course, I devoured the fourth book within two weeks. Now I was having withdrawl symptoms and was in the same predicament as everyone else, waiting for book 5--Harry Potter and The Order of The Pheonix.Rumors flew the whole time about J. K. Rowling having writers block and fake release dates, and of course the tension has been building since then.Now, the book is out and I have already finished it over the weekend. I took it in at 2 and 3 hour sessions, and read it in two days. I really did not want to finish it so quickly, but the book really drew me in and I could not put it down. It is a very dense book, filled with lots of important details referencing all of the previous books, and lots of guessing. I never knew what was going to happen next and I like that. I hate knowing what is coming and J. K. Rowling is very good at keeping you in the dark. Especially the fact that everyone knows, even before the book came out, that one major character dies. So much happened at the end of the book, so many people being attacked, that I was totally surprised when I did find out who had died. Also, this book is much different from the previous installments as the light hearted nature of Harry has been subdued and replaced by an overly emotional, demanding, confused, raging, angry Harry coming into his own at 15, dealing with so much pressure and consequence, just for being alive and not getting killed.In some ways, I felt that book 5 didn't match the first four and was a bit weighed down with all of the negativity between Harry, Ron and Hermione, and all of the other characters like Dumbledore, Sirius, Lupin, Hagrid, Snape and the Ministry. I felt quite frustrated, although this is an intergral part of what makes book 5 so unique and daring and special, as J. K. Rowling makes you truly understand what Harry is feeling throughout the book. Even though it was shocking at first, it makes the reader identify with what Harry has had to endure all these five years and how it is affecting him personally, and those around him.I will definitely have to re-read this book several more times to catch things I missed the first time through. So much is significant to what happened in the previous four and clues laid for what happens in book 6 and 7.  Now of course, I am not sure I can wait that long for the 6th book to be released. I hope it will only be a year or so this time as J. K. Rowling has said book 6 will not be as lengthly or take as long to write as book 5 did. So we can hope for the end of 2004 at the latest as well as look forward to the third movie to come out June 2004. It will probly be at least 4 or 5 years until book 5 comes out as a movie, if at all, but hopefully so.Overall, it should be no surprise that this 5th book is the best in the series so far. In my mind, it ties for first place with the 4th book. I am looking forward to Harry growing up even more, finding out more about his past, and figuring out his future. I feel the books are getting more adult than the first four but it doesn't alienate the younger core audience as they are growing up too, and certainly welcomes older adults--young at heart like myself--who like fantasy and science fiction and a bit of drama and suspense thrown in for good measure. This book is the best so far in the Harry Potter series and it will only get better in book 6 and 7. I can hardly wait!!!!",FALSE,2003,1469
"5199",5,731196,FALSE,"Absolutely enchanting, unless you are a complete Muggle and don't have a drop of Magical blood in you.  I just could not put it down.  Rowling again weaves the completely impossible into the entirely inevitable: Hagrid sent away from Hogwarts? Dumbledore dismissed from Hogwarts? Harry banished from Quiddich? The story line is more believable than the Goblet of Fire, the last one in the series (where you got the feeling at the end that the story line was a bit contrived.)The tension continues to mount throughout the school year, and as exams commense, the inevitable confrontation between The Boy Who Lived and He Who Must Not Be Named occurs. As JRR Tolkien observed about his own magnum opus, the most consistent criticism will be that, even at 870 pages, the book is too short.Grab some Floo powder and get down to Diagon Alley, or better yet, pounce on your mouse and Apparate (virtually) to Amazon (who says magic doesn't exist?) and start reading.

The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher was absolutely hateable and gave me the same feeling I had for Gildory Lockhart... to jump into the book and ring her neck, of course this was not possible.I think there maybe some disagreeing whether or not this book deserved 5 stars, but the last 8 chapters of the book make it up entirely. Everyone knows there is a death, but I'm not a party pooper so you'll have to read it for yourself to find out.All I can say is hopefully, Harry will grow out of his angry phase in the last 2 books and put an end to Lord Voldemort, 'cause we are all surely sick of him.",FALSE,2003,1469

Would it live up to the hype? Up to its predecessors? Will Harry's fans continue to be rewarded for their loyalty?Not to worry. This is the best of the Potters so far, as Rowling handles the advent into adolescence of Harry and his friends with wit and skill. The pleasure in this series is largely in entering the world of Harry, Hogwarts, and the other magical domains Rowling so skillfully describes.The much hyped ""death"" is, honestly, a little anticlimactic, and I will say no more for fear of spoiling it.

And do you really need three hundred or so pages before Harry even gets to Hogwarts? That's longer than the orginal book for crying out loud. I was more impressed with Ron and Ginny this year, but I was seriously wishing to duct tape Harry's mouth shut.Also, it is hard to tell whether there is a plot until the final two hundred pages of the book. Then, JK did something I was extremely mad about, but if you have never read the book, it's probably best if I don't tell you what it is.I really hope the last two books become more like the original, because this book really does not compare to them.",FALSE,2003,1489

And, I'm sure that once you've read the book and thought about it, you will agree.Major points of the book:1. This book is basically centered around a war that rages between Dumbledore (and his supporters) and the Ministry of Magic: The Ministry does not believe that Lord Voldemort is back and denies (not that they deny it, they just ignore what had happened) it before the Magical Community. But, as you might remember Dumbledore nevertheless stated to the whole school that Voldemort did, in fact, come back. However, because no Ministry Official supports that statement, nothing is being done and students, having spent their summers away from school come back thinking that Harry Potter is a quack (this belief is further fueled by articles in the Daily Prophet) and that Dumbledore is losing his touch. Thus, Ministry is trying to interfere in the way that Hogwarts is run by appointing their candidate for the post of the Defence against the Dark Arts teacher, a most horrible person you can imagine, who really drills it into her students' heads that whatever Dumbledore has told them about Lord Voldemort's return, is bogus. Harry, especially, gets the most of her wrath because he dares to oppose her. Thus, only a handful of students and parents believe that Lord Voldemort is back. Like I said, most of the book is dedicated to this war.2. Major revelations are made in this fifth book, most important of which is WHY LORD VOLDEMORT TRIED TO KILL HARRY POTTER when he was a baby. This revelation is made only in the end.3. Most of the drama takes place in the last 100 pages of the book. Of course, everyone knows that a character dies. I will not reveal who dies, but, most of you probably know it already. However, though he is an important character, I feel that I did not know him very well. His loss of course, is major to Harry.4. A noticeable difference from the four previous books, is that Ms. Rowling no longer introduces the character (I mean, she doesn't say that Harry Potter is not an ordinary boy but a wizard, it point blank terms). Thus, you would definitely have to have read the previous books in order to really enjoy this one.5. As with the four other novels, Ms. Rowling did a fantastic job with this book. The writing is superb and, though it might be a little too long, it's very thorough and was worth the wait. I hope, though, she hurries up with the next one, though of course, I will be disappointed if it's not as detailed as this one.I will now, no doubt, listen to the audio book because I think that Jim Dale does an amazing job and he, if it is at all possible, makes the book even better.Just to conclude, an excellent read!

"5207",3,731194,FALSE,"As pointed out in other reviews, this fifth installment suffers from many flaws that lessens its interest to a certain degree, but only to a certain degree.  HP and the Order of the Phoenix forms part of the bigger picture that the seven books will constitute, and as such it brings an important contribution to the development of the story we are being told.  It continues to be a must for anybody interested in the HP ""saga"".  And it is highly enjoyable.The flaws:- the storytelling is cumbersome and rambling, dwells meaninglessly in trifles that do not advance the plot and defuse the tension accumulated throughout the previous pages.  The Goblet of Fire was also 700ish pages long, still every single one of them was needed: the story in the Order of the Phoenix could be told (more effectively, I think) in 300-400 pages.  As an example, and I do not think I will spoil anything, near the end HP and friends need to go quickly from Hogwarts to London; they use some magical creatures that had been introduced previously.  The trip itself takes 4 to 5 pages, adds nothing to the plot, and completely destroys the tension that had been created.  This trip could have been described in one paragraph.Now, I do understand and respect that this is probably a deliberate option on the part of the author.  I just simply point out that it did not work for me, and I cannot stop thinking that should the Sorcerer's Stone been written in this fashion, it would not have been the success it was.- the plot suffers from some major flaws, the Sirius' mirror plot-hole, HP absurd incapacity to understand what Voldemort is up to, and above all a so-called ""revelation"" that Dumbledore has been hiding since day one, an which any self-respecting HP fan guessed from the very first book.  More than a ""revelation"", it is a ""confirmation"", and I fail to see how it changes HP life.  I also fail to see what was Voldemort's interest in it.There are other elements that bothered me (HP's irrational anger throughout the book, that makes him an unpleasant character; the evil characters, extremely one-sided and utterly flat), but I do agree that it's the author's conscious decision on what the story and characters have to be.  It did not work for me, I am not interested in teens angst when I read a HP book, specially because I do not think it adds anything, but it is the author's privilege.Having said that, I enjoyed reading the book, getting again in contact with the characters and the plot, and reading a new installment of the ""saga"".  And the final battle is one of the most thrilling readings I have had in the last few years.In conclusion, if you like HP, buy this book, read it, and re-read the previous while you wait for book six.  You will enjoy it.",FALSE,2003,1473
"5208",4,731193,FALSE,"The words of Confuscious perfectly sum up Harry Potter's life. During Harry's 1st year at Hogwarts he rescued the Sorcerer's Stone and confronted Voldemort (shivers). During his second year he foils Voldemort once more in the Chamber of Secrets. During his third year he faces dementors and saves his godfather/top wizard criminal, Sirius Black, from Azkaban in possibly the richest installment in the series. In his fourth year he inadvertantly competes in the perilous Triwizard Tournament, faces death and witnesses Voldemort's return to power (although nobody believes him).However, Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts poses much more immediate tribulations. He faces lies, mistrust from fellow Hogwarts students, detentions GALORE, yelling matches, confusion, isolation, ""foolish adults that won't tell him anything because he won't understand it,"" and the highly potent and evil Professor Umbridge. Also, Dumbledore mysteriously won't acknowledge Harry or even look at him! These problems even, are overshadowed by a reoccurring dream about the Department of Mysteries that Harry has. But Harry has no respite even in his dreams, as a fearful and realistic vision through Voldemorts eyes turns out to be nothing short of a sort of present prophesy.As Harry's year concludes with a climactic battle in the Department of Mysteries and *cough* another confrontation with Death [Eaters] and Voldemort. But at the very end of the term, Dumbledore finally concedes to Harry and tells him everything he knows about the mysterious connection of him and Voldemort....My complaints about this book are few but important. For one, the book has quite a bit of repetition and supposedly useless subplots. Secondly, Rowling's interpretation of Harry's troubles with puberty are somewhat off. Maybe it's just me, but I would NOT have messed up as much as Harry, even though I have a much worse temper.

"5209",4,731193,FALSE,"The words of Confuscious perfectly sum up Harry Potter's life. During Harry's 1st year at Hogwarts he rescued the Sorcerer's Stone and confronted Voldemort (shivers). During his second year he foils Voldemort once more in the Chamber of Secrets. During his third year he faces dementors and saves his godfather/top wizard criminal, Sirius Black, from Azkaban in possibly the richest installment in the series. In his fourth year he inadvertantly competes in the perilous Triwizard Tournament, faces death and witnesses Voldemort's return to power (although nobody believes him).However, Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts poses much more immediate tribulations. He faces lies, mistrust from fellow Hogwarts students, detentions GALORE, yelling matches, confusion, isolation, ""foolish adults that won't tell him anything because he won't understand it,"" and the highly potent and evil Professor Umbridge. Also, Dumbledore mysteriously won't acknowledge Harry or even look at him! These problems even, are overshadowed by a reoccurring dream about the Department of Mysteries that Harry has. But Harry has no respite even in his dreams, as a fearful and realistic vision through Voldemorts eyes turns out to be nothing short of a sort of present prophesy.As Harry's year concludes with a climactic battle in the Department of Mysteries and *cough* another confrontation with Death [Eaters] and Voldemort. But at the very end of the term, Dumbledore finally concedes to Harry and tells him everything he knows about the mysterious connection of him and Voldemort....My complaints about this book are few but important. For one, the book has quite a bit of repetition and supposedly useless subplots. Secondly, Rowling's interpretation of Harry's troubles with puberty are somewhat off. Maybe it's just me, but I would NOT have messed up as much as Harry, even though I have a much worse temper.

"5210",4,731205,FALSE,"First off, let me say that I am nearly 30 years old, an avid reader, and I love Harry Potter.  J.K. Rowling has a wonderful style that makes it easy to emmerse yourself in the world of witchcraft and wizardry.  So often when I read fantasy books such as these, it becomes difficult to identify with the characters and the world the author presents.  Thankfully, Ms. Rowling does not fall into that trap, and I think its because the series is not a fantasy story, its a coming of age story that happens to be set in a fantasy world.  Ms. Rowling does an excellent job of never letting the reader forget that this is a story about Harry, not about Magic.  Similarly, she keeps the readers in mind:  as Harry grows, so do the books.  They become longer, more complex, even darker, as the readers who began reading the books at a young age will be able to keep reading and identify with Harry as he grows to adulthood.With that said, this book was not as well written as it could have been, given the time it took to write, and especially when it is compared to the other books in the series.  There were also a couple of plot elements which went unexplored, though I'm sure that Ms. Rowling has plans for them in the future.  The climax, too, left me a bit unsatisfied; I wanted more to happen, and a better explaination of the events which occurred than what was offered.Now for the good parts.  It is true that the narrative is a bit slow in the beginning, but I think it sets the right tone for Harry's mood to begin the book.  Most of the criticisms that I have read have also mentioned how whiny and unpredictable Harry is, but I remember when I was 15, and Harry's behavior is very familiar.  Ms. Rowling keeps the story about Harry and the growing pains which come with adolescence.  Finally, the whole of the story, the back plots and what not, are truly gripping; for example the confusion that Harry feels when he finds out what his father had been like at his age was wonderfully done.All in all, Order of the Phoenix is a great read, and the critiques I listed above did not interfere with my enjoyment of the book.  I recommend this book, but I do suggest reading the rest in the series first.  It adds more to the readers' understanding of the back story and references made throughout the book.  Otherwise you may be lost and miss out on a great read.",FALSE,2003,1484
"5213",5,731194,FALSE,"One Word-SpeechlessHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a witty, clever, action-packed, emotional, loving, wonderfully done, brilliant, dark, mysterious, suspenseful, and GREAT book and BY FAR the BEST in the Harry Potter Series!It is deeply emotional.  Harry feels strong anger and hate toward his friends, family, and even dear Albus Dumbledore!  You cannot imagine the way Mrs. Rowling makes you feel these emotions, and how she makes you laugh, cry, and get extremely anxious throughout the story.  Puberty is taking a turn on Harry!This book delivers a batch of intriguing new characters too, more than any other Harry Potter book.  You get to know the grumpy Alastor (Mad-Eye) Moody, the fashionable and clumsy Nymphadora Tonks, the mischivious Kreatcher, the outgoing Luna Lovegood, and last but not least, the carnivorous, vicious, annoying, devilish Hogwarts High Inquisitor and new DADA teacher, Professor Dolores Umbridge.  Each of these characters is unique in thier own way, and bring the story to life!  (Sometimes in negative ways!)The story takes a suprisingly darker turn, and has taken the spot of ""Darkest in the Series,"" which used to belong to Prisoner of Azkaban.  We see hate in the Magical World, and also distrust, prejudice, and of course, the rise of Lord Voldemort..he has created a rift in the Magical World, so there is a break in who believes in his rise, and the others who think it's madness and nonsense.  I loved this darker turn, but I am glad Rowling kept the blood and gore out of this one which was in Goblet of Fire.The action in this book was gripping, from a fast-paced game of Quidditch, to a showdown with Dementors, to a fierce battle with the Death-Eaters.  It did not have the wit of the Triwizard Tournament, but it had that Magical backdrop that all action lovers will appreciate.A basic sypnosis of this book is:Harry has not seen his friends all summer.He has not been in contact with then for almost 4 weeks.After a predicament which puts his Hogwarts life at risk, he is put in the hands of the Order of the Phoenix.He has not known of this group until they rescue him and bring then to there headquarters.Ron and Hermione are now present and tell harry of the Order of the Phoenix, an band of wizards led by Dumbledore that fights the Dark Forces of Lord Voldemort.As he sees his friends, he sees even more at Hogwarts...and that is where the trouble begins...Lord Voldemort has returned...This book was a MASTERPIECE!I recommend it to anyone who appreciates the BEST fantasy literature.I would give this book a zillion stars!",FALSE,2003,1473
"5218",5,731189,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter book to date.  I read it the first day it was out, having picked up three copies in a warehouse store to stop any sibling rivalry, and throughout the day I became somewhat of a celebrity (""Look, he has that new Harry Potter book!"").The beginning of the book is rather unsatisfactory NOTE! QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS FOLLOWSHarry starts out the novel with an attitude never before attributed to Harry Potter:  Arrogance.  He believes (perhaps rightly so), that since he has fought Voldemort in some form three times in four years, he deserves some credit, and that Dumbledore did wrong to lock him up at the Dursleys at Number Four Privet Drive, Whinging Way, London while Ron and Hermione are off enjoying themselves. His boredom is temporarily relieved as he barely fights off two Dementors who had been sent to kill him by and unknown source.It is now that he is initiated to the Order of the Phoenix.  He is told by a neighbor, Mrs. Figg, a Squib (a witch without magic powers), that there is a group of people who Dumbledore has assigned to watch over him and keep him safe, and that as he was fighting the Dementors, there was supposed to be a full wizard there with him.  Harry is shocked to find out that he has been guarded the whole time, yet later that week, while the Dursleys are out, a group of wizards enter Harry's house for his protection, our old friends Lupin and Mad-Eye Moody among them.  They fly to Grimmauld Way, where Harry is told to memorize the address of the Order of the Phoenix headquarters, Number Twelve Grimmauld way.END OF SPOILERSI was bowled over by this book.  J.K. Rowling has managed to describe adolescent emotions just as they should be, and it adds to the plot in such a way that it is possible to believe in a world of magic and wizards.  There are several changes to the staff of Hogwarts, some excellent combat scenes, several romance scenes, a fair amount of comedy, and even an untimely murder at the end (of whom, I will not say!)

I read the Potter books after the 4th book was released and I was captivated by the story, the characters and the writing. Rowling's writing flows easily, and she deceptively hides complex ideas and themes under easily understood text. The book is clunky in a few places, and Harry's constant anxiety wore on me a bit because it felt real to me and I could identify with his frustration. I think the payoff at the end was worth the whole of it.As an adult I think Rowling's work is fantastic and would suggest this book to teens and tweens.

This story holds some very exciting secrets....so much so that it's hard to keep your eyes from jumping ahead on the page.Don't forget to read the books that precede this one.

"5226",4,731190,FALSE,"Wow.Talk about teenage angst! I will admit, I was initially put off by this strange new Harry.Taunting, seething, repeatedly boiling over with anger ... what happened to the innocent, kind, cheerful hero who I so loved? I guess it's just hard seeing him grow up, knowing he'll one day leave us ...J.K. Rowling does an excellent job of working our favorite wizard's personal growth as a magician and boy into a stellar plot. Somehow, she skilfully juggles Harry's I'm-slightly-sick- of-being-the world's-savior attitude, along with all the burdens of his burgeoning adolescence.I loved the development of relationships between characters, particularly between Hermione and Ron.  Also very glad of the end result with Cho. (No spoilers, don't worry.) My favorite scene in the book was the last one with Dumbledore. FANTASTIC, particularly that last line about responsibility.  Professor Umbridge wins my award for the year's most annoying, loathsome villain.I rather wish Draco had featured more prominently, however. And that rhyme he makes up to jeer at Ron seems somehow beneath his cold, unchildlike character.The final chapters are so packed that I had to reread them, and will continue to reread them, numerous times.My primary concern was that the action built almost too quickly at the very end. It was building nicely, evenly, when BANG, all hell breaks loose. Not that I'm complaining; it just left me rather breathless as I sped through the pages at 1:00 AM, with my cup of tea cooling at my side.I was somewhat disappointed in Snape's characterization, I'll admit. I thought we'd made some progress toward showing he had a heart, in the last book. But this book seems to reverse most of that.  Though I'll admit, that scene with the Pensieve made me teary-eyed. Not sure I really WANTED to pity Snape, however ...I will admit that I was not a huge fan of the other four books.  I liked them enough to wait till midnight to buy this edition, but I was never as GaGa as some of my friends.

"5230",5,731190,FALSE,"There has been some controversey over the darkness and complexity of the Harry Potter books as the series has progressed, some arguing that the later, longer books with their dense plotlines and deaths of major characters become offputting to the intended age group of children 9-12.  However, while complex in plot, the fifth installment in the Harry Potter series, like it's four predecesors,  employs a narrative style so simple that young readers will not be scared off so easily.  Furthermore, part of Rowling's intention in writing these stories was to show the adult world how much they underestimate children, and she is proven right again and again as children (and adults, for that matter) around the world continue to fall in love with her books BECAUSE of their intricate plotlines, not in spite of them.As far as the darkness and death involved in the novels, their purpose does not seem to be to scare the readers.  As a reader, we become one with Harry, seeing the world as he sees it (particularly due to the limited omniscence of the narrator).  While this world may be dark and frightening, we find ourselves alongside such faithful companions as Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, George, Fred, Ginny, Nevile, Dumbledore, and countless other characters who are so lovable and loyal to Harry that the reader never truly feels as if he or she is in danger.  Instead, the frightening aspects of the books teach young readers NOT to be afraid, as Harry and his friends, who--apart from being wizards--are quite normal children, overcome these obstacles.  The overriding message to children, therefore, is that anyone, no matter how small they feel they are, can overcome the obstacles put in THEIR paths as well.  In essence, the books aren't about magic as much as they're about child empowerment, teaching children how strong they can truly be.As for the rest of the book, it is truly a treat!  The good guys are so good and the bad guys so bad that anyone with the slightest inner child will squeal with delight as these characters, who the reader easily becomes emotionally attatched to, will share in the characters' triumphs and defeats.

One of the great things about Rowling is how she adapts Harry to the personality quirks that come with the age group. He's a teen, so now he's edgy and cranky -- and instead of just going to ask for help, he is holding things in more. Typical teenager, and it all works into the story.

"5235",5,731189,FALSE,"Well, as a mother of a teenaged boy, I'm glad to see that Harry is finally acting like a real teenager.  He's angry all the time, sasses teachers, is shocked to find out his father wasn't perfect, and worries about what he's going to do for a living when he graduates.  All told, he handles it very well considering he's had very little adult guidance.  I'm always amazed at how poorly Dumbledore and the other teachers have tried to deal with Harry's emotional needs, which are considerable given his orphan's life.The book is less scary than Goblet, and the final battle scene (there's always one) is less convincing.  Still, the sadistic teacher Harry encounters is enough to make any parent pull their kids our of boarding school.  I do hope Rowling gets tired of Harry and Snape snarling at each other, it's getting tedious.  It's obvious they'll make up sooner or later (Harry gains insight in OotP into Snape's dislike of his father) so get on with it.Rowling creates wonderful characters, but she can be a tease, giving us a glimpse of two great new Aurors but not giving them more development.  But really, isn't the bald black one with an earring a ripoff of Mace Windu?  I kept waiting for his to pull out a lightsaber instead of a wand.The entire book is a condemnation of adult incompetence and foolishness, until the very end when the real wisdom of some peoples' actions are revealed.  This is in keeping with the adolescent discovery of how stupid adults (like me) really are.  Although Harry makes some big mistakes, he finally becomes established as a leader among his peers, which is significant.The much-ballyhooed death is in fact heartbreaking and the description of Harry's grief is eerily accurate for anyone who has ever lost a loved one.

There are many moments when you wish that you didn't need sleep so you could just devour the book whole, and others where, quite frankly, you could care less (i.e. -- the Quidditch matches, except after Ron's win were quite dull and kind of mean) The only reason I gave this 4/5 was because right up until the last... 50 pages I thought this was the best, and no, I was not changed by the death of the character, all though it was heart wrenching, it was rather the very rushed attempt to just end it that left me feeling a little dry.

It sounded almost too much like Fan Fiction to me. However, they were still nonetheless enjoyable, and kept me happily turning the pages.

Professor Snape for one was given such amazing depth, and the character of his that Rowling has been hinting at in the prevous four books come out finally in this one.TOoTP is a well concoted potion of adventure,horror,comedy and even a little teen-flick romance, which I thought, before reading, might be a little akward in the book. But Rowling excecutes it with some amazing delicacy, contancy and accuracy that I cannot help but applaude her at the successful effort.The only thing lamentable would be the seemingly rushed ending, where I felt it too obvious that she was expressively trying to tie up all the 'loose-ends' with Dumbledor's revelation in his office after the battle in the ministry, and well, basically trying to end the story.I had hoped for more attention to be paid to a certain evil character (minor spoiler*) Umbridge (//minor spoiler) before term ended.Basically, the ending was rushed.

Harry is all angsty and angry as well he should be. Harry whines a little much but given what has happened to him in the past few years it is believable without being a parody. For me this is the Catcher in the Rye at Hogwarts. Harry and company are beginning to grow up and Harry really seems to disconnect from those around him.Voldemort isn't going anywhere and it seems that all the talk about his evilness may have been understating things. After being a incorporeal ideal for so long it is exciting and new to the reader to have the physical Voldemort in the book. It was a brilliant move on Rowling's part. Voldemort could have really turned into the cliche villian if done wrong but even 5 books in Voldemort is fresh and new for the reader.

It is no longer something a 7 year old can relate too.The final set piece contains some heartbreak and showdowns that have been building for 4 books. They don't disappoint.

"5248",3,731979,FALSE,"I have only recently started to read the Harry Potter books and decided to do so with the impending 4th movie coming out. My 10 year old had read all 6 books. So I quickly read through books 1-4 and thoroughly enjoyed them, especially book 4 which left me on a high wanting more.  I immediately picked up book 5 and enjoyed the first few chapters.After that, it was all downhill. It was 25 chapters of boring school life with nothing of any interest happening. I began to dislike Harry Potter's character on a major scale. Whinny, arrogant and angry, he just rubbed me up the wrong way and it was a major chore to plod along and get through the rest of the book.Harry just seems incapable of figuring anything out for himself and always needs to be given the answer. He ignores the only person who consistently is intelligent enough to provide answers, - Hermione. He also ignores the people he supposedly loves and respects when they are all telling him that his new class with Snape is the single most important thing he must do.  Even the sub story of Cho was annoying. I know Harry is only 15, but no one is that stupid. His indifference to Cho and her feelings made me dislike Harry even more.However,  despite chapter after chapter of desperately waiting for something to happen, I knew I had to keep going. There was obviously going to be some major event at the end.  Even those events were lame and confusing. The whole issue with the importance of the prophecy sphere did not make sense. Also, how was everyone able to just walk into the Ministry of Magic?  The only worthwhile part of the book was the chapter in Dumbledore's office where we were finally told a few unknowns.Being part of 7 books, you have to read it, but seriously, this book could have been 300 pages max. Cut out most of the stuff in the middle and expand the ending a little, and it would have been on par with book 3.

I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because there's a bit too much deus ex machina in the climax, and a monologue by Dumbledore at the end that, while cool and extremely intriguing, just comes out of left field.  On the plus side, this is the best character development in a book that I've seen in a LONG time.  Harry comes across as a perfect adolescent (at least to my recollection, and it wasn't that long ago), alternately angry, confused, and full of righteous indignation.  For the first time I felt connected with Harry, and I genuinely cared what happened to him.  While it seemed to me that Ron and Hermione got some short shrift in the development department, almost all of the other characters were extremely well fleshed out.  A lot of backstory is revealed and I left the book with a sense that I understand the characters.  Snape is no longer just a jerk; the Twins aren't just one trick joke ponies.  The list goes on and on.This book is definitely darker than the previous volumes in the series.  The book does a wonderful job of bringing up tension for the climax that might disturb younger readers who don't realize everything will (probably) turn out right in the end.  One other warning though: while the book stands alone very well, I last read the previous volumes several years ago and had to keep consulting my girlfriend on the relevance of some events and characters (she having read them more recently).  The book is jam packed with reference to previous events, and it would be very useful if the reader were to read this after a careful rereading of the previous volumes.This is definitely the best in the series so far, and if J.K. Rowling has to get sued, get married, contract writers block, and/or take another 3 years for the next volume, so be it.  I'll be there at 12:01 AM sometime in the next few years for the next volume.",FALSE,2003,1467

Does Hogwarts have counselors? Why is everyone always so stern? No one investigates the detention time with Umbridge? It sounds like he was at Maryville Academy in the Chicago area. What kid could survive what Harry has so far and not ended up a criminal or worse? It was the love of Harry's parents that saved him from Voldemort but I don't see any real love at Hogwarts.

"5257",3,731869,FALSE,"I liked this book. My problem is not with the length but with the editing and feeling like I've read a lot of this before. I went back to the first book and it was tightly written and fun. The Order of the Phoenix is rough and bloated; it feels about two drafts away from being complete (Rowling has hinted that this is the case: she says she eventually ran out of time and energy at the end. ).  And someone has got to tell her to rein in the adverbs after the word ""said"".  I understand that Rowling is now possibly the best selling author of all time. That doesn't mean that her editor should abdicate their responsibility to bring a truly complete , polished, and well-edited book to market.The deja vu aspect is that the Dursley's are still despicable, the Slytherins continue to snicker and make fun of the gang with Rowling continuing to use the same descriptors (how many times can Pansy Parkinson shriek before she loses her vocal chords?), and Snape still is unfair. I guess I'm looking for a little more complexity. Are all Slytherin's evil? That wasn't the original premise. Is Snape still out to get Harry? The end of the 4th book indicated some new mission for Snape which never gets fully expicated in the 5th book. There are surprises here as far as the plot goes.

"5258",5,731194,FALSE,"Well, where to begin? After three years in production, the newest and fifth Harry Potter, subtitled Order of the Phoenix, finally hit the shelves on 21st June 2003.But does it really live up to the hype? The answer is very simple: Absolutely.Harry Potter: The Order of the Phoenix, is an outstanding book which again demonstrates why J.K. Rowling is an excellent author. The story begins with Harry once again in 4, Privet Drive, but whereas many of the previous books are lighthearted and jovial, the Order of the Phoenix is very dark and at times sinister. Rowling has blended in the attributes which made her first four books hits with a more serious and at times intense nature that is adolescence. No longer is Harry Potter the innocent boy next door, but a teenager who is finding a hard balance between friendships, loyalty, expectations and love.Similar to the other 4 books, Harry is taken on a trip which twists, bends, turns around and sometimes upside down as he continues his struggle against Lord Voldemort. Many lovable characters from the previous books have departed, such as Oliver Wood, and many more will leave as the battle with the Dark Lord reaches a boiling point.This Harry Potter is perhaps the best one so far, because all the characters are now further developed and even more human than before. Whereas the previous four usually involved a mystery type storyline, Order of the Phoenix leans more towards keeping Harry in the dark so he won't be exposed to things he can't handle. The book also shows a coming of age in Harry through the story, as different experiences and new friends bring him to a realisation that everything will never be as it seems.This is an O (for Outstanding) grade book, I recommend it to people of all ages and particularly Harry Potter fans as it's simply 'unputdownable'. Cheers.",FALSE,2003,1473
"5260",5,731189,FALSE,"I just finished reading the 5th book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. To prepare myself for the release I re-read books 3 and 4 so I would ready for 5. I wasn't disapointed. The story follows Harry through his 5th year at Hogwarts, while prepares to take his O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Level's) along with Ron and Herminone. What separates this book from the others is that Harry, now 15 is angry and resentful. He's angry about Cedric Diggory's death, He's angry that no one will tell him what's happening in the wizarding world while he's stuck at Number 4 Privet drive, and he's angry because he feels alone in the world knowing what he does and few others beleive, that he who shall not be named has returned.J.K. Rowling does again in this book what she has done in the previous ones, she gives us yet another glimpse of the Wizarding world, richly woven with all of the details you would expect from the creater of Bernie Botts every flavor beans. What she also does, is give us more insight into what the connection is between Harry and Lord Voldemort, as well other connections between characters, like James Potter and Severus Snape.While it is well known that someone close to Harry dies in this book (and I won't reveal who), this event doesn't happen until the end, leaving the reader constantly to conjecture on who it is.This book was a definite page turner, I read it for two days straight to finish the story.  When I finally did finish it, however, I didn't feel regret that it was over, rather more saddend by the turn of events.  This book was excellent, although it leaves you feeling a bit uneasy at times. Harry is very angry at the world, due to events past, present and future. When you add 15 year old hormones and girl problems to that, you get an absolutely riviting portrayal of a teenage wizard coming of age.",FALSE,2003,1468
"5264",5,731220,FALSE,"This was about Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. The first hundred pages or so, didn't actually take place at the school. He spends the summer as usual at his aunts and uncles, although he was pretty restless about not having any info on you-know-who, and was reduced to hiding in flower beds to listen to the muggle news.Harry is a little annoying at first, whining a bunch, but I can understand why, although I wish that he would be a little more tolerant. J. K. Rowling is a wonderful author, and she has only gotten more talented. Ron's character is at his best in this book, and he is really funny. Hermione is the same as always, but she loosens up a little on the rule breaking thing",FALSE,2003,1499
"5265",5,731188,FALSE,"First and foremost, I admit that this is not as much of a review as it could be. It is more so a response to the negative critisim that is being unfairly bestowed on the book. It baffles me that some reviewers don't seem to understand why Harry is not as lovable and innocent as he once was. In The Order of the Phoenix, he's dealing with emotions that most would find too strong to handle. And on top of it all, he is dealing with the emotions typical of a 15 year-old boy. The latter obviously clouding his judgment. Of course he's not as externally likable as he was when he was new to the wizarding world. If he was, I would throw the book down in a second, out of sheer irritation that the characters are not developing. And I'm quite sure most would do the same. Therein lies the problem. J.K. Rowling was faced with the inevitable decision of how to handle the character development of a group of adolescents. In which there were only two possible outcomes. The first (and the easiest) would be that the characters would change only physically, not reflecting the true changes which occur with growth. Then there is the option to allow the characters to grow, and more importantly, allow the reader to grow with the characters. Needless to say, Rowling made the correct decision. Had the characters not changed the way they did throughout book five, it would be possible for a fan to ""grow out of Harry Potter."" And to grow out of a book is to realize that the book was not very good to begin with. Regarding the plot, which I have also heard many complaints about; it was not about a stone. It was not about a chamber. It was not about making enemies. And it wasn't about a tournament. In fact, the plot of The Order of the Phoenix was much different from any of its predecessors. That being said, does this mean the book is without a plot? Certainly not. From the very beginning of the book it was obvious that there was trouble in the wizarding world. What with lengths the Ministry of Magic is going to to prevent an announcement that the most feared wizard is back in power, not many individuals are accepting of those who state otherwise. This dilemma has been, and always will be, a crucial part of the Harry Potter series. It was indeed important that this aspect be incorporated significantly into a book. It could not have been less prominent, and it could not have been a quick process. It is the entire concept behind fear and its place in reality. As I do not wish to divulge any spoilers here, and it would be difficult for me to refrain if I continued in more depth, I will try to wrap this up in saying that The Order of the Phoenix is a brilliant piece of literature. It is hilarious, dark, heartbreaking and unique, while staying true to the magic that the first four has shown so many.",FALSE,2003,1467
"5266",5,731193,FALSE,"Harry Potter books are my favorite books up to date (next to Lord of the Rings), and I cannot pick a favorite book. This book is great and it is almost impossible to stop and put it down for a break. It has more pages than any other Harry Potter book so far yet you will still fly through the pages in a matter of no time. In this book, Harry is now 15 years old! It may be a little disappointment to others but he has finally grown out of being a sweet, loving child and turned into a selfish, a little bit bossy teenage boy, (just like my brother). Harry also once agains encounters You-Know-Who and has to fight him with the help of the ""Order of the Pheonix"", a group of undercover wizards and witches against Voldermort and his death eaters.There is also a new defense against the dark arts teacher at the school of Hogwarts named Prof. Umbridge who Harry hates as much as Snape. A lot of other new things are goind around Hogwarts such as Ron, as the new keeper of the Gryfindor Quiditch team, Ron and Hermione as prefects, and Harry and Cho Chang are finally having a go with a relationship.

Rowling has done a wonderful job of showing us Harry and his friends as real people.Rowling has also introduced a fabulously annoying new villian.  I slammed my book down in disgust several times when Prof.  Umbrage was on the scene.Thr book is much darker in tone than the previous 4 and might be disturbing to younger children as things are not so neatly divided into good/bad as they have been in the past.

"5269",5,731184,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban tells of Harry's third year at Hogwarts School at Witchcraft, and the book takes a fairly close second to Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite so far.The very basic plot of the story includes an escaped prisoner from Azkaban, the high-security prison of the wizarding world. It seems that this prisoner is after Harry, presumably to kill him. The dementors, guards of Azkaban, are brought to Hogwarts to ""protect"" the school and recapture the Prisoner. The stories within the story include Harry developing a special friendship with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. As always, Harry is learning more and more about his past, and his parents.I think that what made this book in particular one of my favorites were the two new and important characters, Sirius Black (the Prisoner of Azkaban) and Professor Lupin (Harry's new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher). The main plotline following Black is what provides most of the suspense in the story. He also, however, provides much of the emotional factor that has placed the book very close to the top on my list of favorites. Thanks to the author for putting more of him in Book 4, and hopefully Book 5, 6, and 7 as well.Lupin is one of my favorite characters as well, and he too provides much of the emotional value in the story due to his connection with Harry's past and his parents. I already said that he was one of my favorites, and I'm pretty sure he'll be around in Book 5, even though we missed him in Goblet of Fire - that's something that I'm excited about.In my opinion, J.

"5273",3,731942,FALSE,"J.K. Rowling herself mentioned that she needed to revise the entire series soon as all the books are out ...

Dolores Umbridge was a highly developed character in this book, but it appears from book 6 that she is no longer going to play an important role after her dismissal. So why devote so much energy on her meanness (which was, by the way, quite effective) in this book, when it could have been focused on other important characters?Books 3, 4 and 6 are quite true to the series in that these provided momentum for the final battle that we all anticipate. Book 5 reveals important details such as Snape's reasons for hating James Potter & Sirius, the protective magic in the Privet Drive residence, the organization of the Order of the Phoenix and the extent of the loyalty of the Death Eaters. But other than those, it was difficult to get into the battle scenes. In fact, I was not affected even by Sirius' death ... it felt as if it was a last-ditch attempt to try to get some sympathy from the reader.In my opinion, the Dumbledore Lessons of Book 6 should've been told in Book 5 -- Harry needed that after witnessing Cedric's murder in Book 4!!! You don't leave somebody in the dark after witnessing something like that!!! Now by the end of Book 6 Harry has to destroy the LV horcruxes by himself ...

He faces what's been hiding at the back of his mind for four years - his anger.

Harry suffers from jealousy, rage, impatience, isolation...and of course, loss. There IS a death in book five. Of this topic I will say no more except that Harry is really given the oppurtunity to grow and expand from the death.The ratings for book five have decreased, but I firmly believe that Rowling hasn't yet lost her touch. People need to get used to the idea that she's doing something different. True, the ending is unsettling and there are moments of confusion, but you could say book five is a precedent for the following two. The book is leading up for the final 'war', and if the reader really combs the book over, you'd find many forshadowing bits that JK likes to tease us with.No, the book's not a disappointment at all. It's rich and haunting, and it's about time Harry develops some character of his own, instead of being guided by everybody else. We meet new characters and see our old favorites.

The humour relieves you while the hardship brought tears to my eyes. Characters came to life as they reminded me of people in my life.

"5276",3,731192,FALSE,"This book's pacing suffers from the constraints of having to begin and end with the school year, and as with the previous books (most noticeably Philosopher's Stone),  the children's lack of trust in the adults around them, fostered by those adults' attempts to shield the children from dangerous or unsettling consequences, leads everyone into peril, this time with tragic consequences.While this is certainly a grimmer book over-all than the previous ones, I found the much-dreaded main-character fatality far less immediately disturbing than Cedric's death in Goblet of Fire, despite the tragedy of it being an almost completely preventable death.The book adds to its cast of odiously over the top villains with Dolores Jane Umbridge, Cornelius Fudge's undersecretary who forces her way up to Hogwarts' headmastery and has obviously taken a page on disciplinary measures from Franz Kafka's ""In the Penal Colony,"" while  Percy Weasley fulfills a supporting role as Ministry-flunky estranged from the rest of his family, Neville starts to come into his own, Ron is given a chance to shine, Aunt Petunia exhibits some unexpected (and unexpectedly sympathetic) backbone, and we see far more of the frailty and failings of many of our favoured characters.While a few of the expected consequences have arisen from the end of the last (Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry prove predictably obstreperous, Hagrid and Olympe complete a mission to find the exiled giants, Firenze is exiled from the other centaurs, and  we find out a bit more about Hagrid's and Neville's families), Dumbledore's touted ""I shall tell all"" at the end of the book does little more than leave us with a standard-issue prophecy and a certain measure of dread about the future.",FALSE,2003,1471

I finished it around 4:30 in the morning (dumb considering I had school that day) and then when I finally got to sleep, I found my sleep vastly disturbed by dreams, nightmares, really, of what I had read in the book.Let me just say, ""Wow."" in a very awed and reverent tone.  This book is completely outstanding from page one all the way until the end.  I had managed to forget what it was to be 15, HP5 reminded me so forcefully that it was giving me goosebumps.  And, lord almighty, when Mrs. Weasley was messing with the boggart, I could swear that my heart stopped on that page until I gathered the courage to read on.  The really scary part is that I REMEMBER acting just like how Harry acts in the book at 15; the tantrums, the feeling like everyone is out to get you or having a laugh at your expense, keeping you in the dark...I felt all that.  And I have never hated a character as much as I hate Umbridge...I loath that woman with every fiber of my being as she exemplifies every authority figure in my life that has taken away things from me most unjustly.  I cheered aloud when Hermione and Harry did their thing with her at the end.  Also, when they saw Neville in the hospital, I bit my fist, no lie, to keep from just loosing it, what an awesome scene, made even more poignant by Neville's silence.  I did loose it at the end, even though I knew it was coming (drat spoilers anyhow) and some of the stuff in the offices were rolling about in my nightmares Sunday night.Weird, I have never had a nightmare about a book before.  Movies, yes, books, no.That's ok, I wouldn't have traded reading this book for all the peacefull nights sleep in my life.  Oh, and just for the record, I'm a 28 year old college student who resisted the HP hype until I saw The Chamber of Secrets on DVD.

But what I rarely see mentioned in reviews is just how much Harry Potter has created a whole renaissance of interest in magic. At first it disturbed some people and calls were made for the books to be banned as 'witchy' etc. But magic is an ancient tradition of understanding the working of the cosmos and of everyday life, and it has been a revelation to see it become second-nature as a topic of conversation between children and also adults. Earlier books which explored the English magical tradition like The Lord of the Rings (Harry Potter came before the revival of this in the films) and The Way of Wyrd dealt with magic in a deeper way. Books after the Harry Potter series have been inspired by it to have adolescents as the protagonists, as in His Dark Materials. I even think that JK Rowling paved the way for mass audiences for books like The Da Vinci Code, where mystery and magic lie just beneath the surface of everyday life.

But by Sunday, I'd finished it, and wow. This is a great book. Sadly, it creates more questions than it resolves, and it is more of a set up for the NEXT book. Another warning: Gone is the safe feeling that existed in the previous books, that, even if Harry's world is crazy, there will always be constants to return to. Not Quidditch, not  the noble order of the school, or funny goings on in classes. It's all crazy, mostly due to the loathesome Umbridge. Romance? Not the giddy teen rubbish so popular in many books. The death comes as a terrible blow, one wonderful character, we barely new them. My very favorite character (since book one), Neville, has proven himself at last. Poor Harry has, understandably, become quite weakened by the power of events and his feelings, though frustrating to the reader, is believable and well captured in the writing. Many new characters, many puzzles, and the ""main"" problems are almost overshadowed by the closer issues of the school.  Everything is mad, but handled in the clever, poetic style of the other books. Less clues for this plot, but troves for the future. Lack of Dumbledore as annoying to the reader as it is for Harry, but makes sense in the end. This is is well-written, I love the style (Though it feels almost as if it was over-edited in one or two spots, removing that certain something in her work), it captures the best in psychology, mystery, and fantasy.

Regardless, it is the best Harry Potter experience I've had so far and definitely a great read.  I got it at midnight and finished it by the next afternoon.  The reading level difficulty has continued to climb with this book, which I think is great.  My 11 y/o needs a challenging book she actually wants to read.Well Done Ms. Rowling!

"5304",3,731215,FALSE,"I offer my sincerest condolences to those avid Harry Potter fans who so eagerly anticipated the release of the fifth installment of JK Rowling's fantasy series. As a devoted HP reader myself, I understand any and all disappointment in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. We deserved better from such a talented writer as Rowling.In HP5, it is apparent for the first time that Harry is growing up. His crush on Cho has intensified. He is impulsive and willful. He is moody (to a fault: here ""moody"" means, almost by default, ""angry""). He wants some answers, and he wants them NOW.Harry as a teenager is the book's first fault: he is too angry too often. Rowling has left out the most important part of being a teenager--more intense even than the angst is the intense relief from it that friendship brings. To be fair, Ron and Hermione cannot give that kind of solace in this book--they are less developed than in the other books. While Harry is growing up, Ron and Hermione aren't. There is little camaraderie between Harry and the others, and as far as we can see they share none of the angst, rebelliousness, or crush-love that Harry feels.Rowling's other big error was with Sirius. As a reader I had a hard time liking Sirius in this book--in the time Rowling devotes to him, all he does is mope around the house, disobey Dumbledore's orders (in place to keep him, a wanted fugitive, safe), and give plenty of advice to Harry that only ends up endangering his godson. I can accept this of a 15-year-old boy; but not of an adult who is far better able than Harry to see reasons for things.But as the title of this review says, HP5 is also FUN. The good parts of this book are not just good, but Rowling at her absolutely delightful best--well-written and engaging, with a gift for character development and for accurate, wry descriptions of both the humorously mundane and the fantastically magical. The chapters devoted to the Dursleys are superb. Funny and horrible as ever, the Dursleys have become real characters--they are undergoing change, and they have histories. Fred and George Weasley and Neville Longbottom are also fantastic here--they too are becoming more real, with histories, futures, and purpose.Rowling's descriptions of the Department of Mysteries is some of her most imaginative work--firstly, she thinks to admit that there are mysteries in the world, such as time, that even wizards do not understand. Second, she has come up with perfect ways to represent these mysteries physically.Much of what is frustrating about this book could have been easily fixed with a more complete editing process. I blame Rowling's publisher for this book's disappointments, because HP5 has the potential to be the greatest yet of Harry's adventures.",FALSE,2003,1494
"5305",3,731186,FALSE,"I, like many others, have immersed myself in the Harry Potter series. I thouroghly enjoyed the first four, and have read each over 4 times. I was highly anticipating the fifth novel.When the book came out I finished it in less than seven hours because I could not wait to know what happened. But, to be honest, I was a bit dissapointed.The plot itself was driven and is what kept me reading. But, the characters seemed lifeless compaired to the novel's predacessors. They lacked depth and intrigue. It was as if they were literally just going through the motions of life. The newly introduced characters were interesting, yet it seemed as if they were almost forced into the book, they appeared to be a bit out of place.The first half of the book was, and believe me I hate to say it, incredibly boring. Nothing of very much importance happened, and it seemed as if many of the parts were useless details that were only written to ""increase suspense"". What could have been written and expressed amazingly in sixty pages took almost one hundred.One thing that really irked me throughout the novel was that it offered little to no help in reminding the reader of any past events that did not occur in the final chapters of ""the Goblet of Fire""(for example, Diggory's death and the return of Voldemort). Many of the people I know that read it were confused about the termanology and character relationships, since they had not read about them in almost three years. I believe that the book should have had a bit more information on what 'aurors"" and ""animagus"" and such other things are.Oh, and another was that, though some people were mentioned and some events were brought up, many of the story lines from past books were ignored. For example, what ever happened to Peter pettigrew? He was mentioned in the chapter titled ""Snape's Worst Memory"", but never in ""present"" time. Also, Hermione's relationship with Krum is barely touched on, as is professor Snape's reasons for leaving the death eaters.Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book immensely, but I think that, dispite the publisher's pushing the author to put it into print sonner, the author should have revised it more.Though I do not think that the first half of the book was all that good, I think that the ending of the book was expertly written and expressed. The suprise character death (which everyone knew was coming, we just didn't know who) was beautifully done in a sentimental, non-rushed way. The conclusion of the book was, if I may say, perfect, and left many spaces open for development in the next novel.So, overall I enjoyed the novel. The only reason it did not get four or five stars is because I think that it could have been written better and had the plot expanded a bit more.I would suggest this book to everyone because it was very entertaining, although tedious at points, and is a must read for all Harry Potter fans.

He's getting older and more mature, as are his friends.The book starts with Harry in a very contrary mood, which colors a good deal of the novel in a darker light so far not explored in the series.Harry can be annoying at times, especially when he jumps to snap conclusions about other characters' motives that common sense doesn't necessarily support.

The Prisoner of Azkaban is yet another one of J K Rowling's masterpieces of modern literature ... and trust me, the later books are even better if you just luuurvve to read. The Goblet of Fire and The Order of The Pheonix, although quite daunting in size,  never have a dull moment. They will lose you even more hours of sleep than this one, trust me!I shan't tell you what happpens in book 3 because lots of others may have given you a hint already. All I can say is that we find out just a little bit more about what happened to Harry's parents the night he was orphaned, and more importantly, why. Every character has something important to tell; ""but was that the way it REALLY happened?"", you'll be left wondering, still. Well, you'll never know until you reach the end!As an aspiring writer, I would just like to say a few words about what I think about the author also, pay a little homage, you know .....J K Rowling is able to tell her story with perfect elegance all through. When you read Harry Potter the pages just turn and turn and turn, and you finish each chapter feeling gratified because every sentence is remembered, every one has aroused your senses, and you are left even keener to read on.The down to earth prose and dialougue she uses astounds me. From her first two books we know the characters so well we can sometimes predict how they will react or behave in a situation, yet as we learn more about the magical world of the non-muggles, we are still left utterly surprised by change. Suddenly, everything little and large detail makes sense because the plot is so solid, and not a single rock is left unturned.I think J K Rowling was born to write. Her imagination knows no boundaries, since she takes everything that is ordinary and, with the swiftest of sentences, turns it into something wonderfully but simply magical. Sometimes when she describes new magic to us, it's almost as if it should have been obvious to us in the first place; That's how well she writes! It's like a subtle wave of her magic wand.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far my favourite book because it is just right in quality and quantity, and considering all the oher books are amazing I'd say this one's ruddy good indeed!So what should you do now you've read this review.?

In fact a teenage Harry. Much is written about JK Rowling's imagination and storylines. But she has created such interesting characters. Hermione grows with every book.

A teenager! And teenagers are often angry, selfish, and annoying. Besides, his life isn't exactly picture perfect. Personally, I believe it was a step that Rowling needed to take. Had she continued to portray Harry as friendly and agreeable all the time, it would have made the book less realistic, especially for teen readers. One of the things that makes these books so popular is that kids can identify with Harry.But he's still the same Harry, and my opinion of him did not change. However, he was not the only one to be depicted as a flawed human being. In fact, many of the characters in this book are shown to be imperfect. This is something, I think, not to find annoying but to appreciate. It brings us closer to the characters. For we have all been, at one time, angry or whiny or scared ourselves. Rowling doesn't sugar-coat things, for her books are not meant to be fairy tales. Those qualities that are unattractive are shown to be unattracive. The beautiful ones to be truly beautiful.Though this book is darker than the last, I enjoyed it more. Rowling packs quite a lot into it, even for its size.

We see him struggling with his lack of a family and we see him lose another member which leaves him severely distaught.He also faces many more obstacles this year including a new defense against the dark arts teacher who is anything but nice.Harry has been going through many emotional struggles since Cedric Diggory's death in the tournament and his return to school is one filled with questions and stares. In the book we also see Hermuione really defy school rules and become more like harry and ron. This book is darker, scarier and pulls at your heartstrings in ways the other four books did not do. Of course, as with all of the books in this series, you can count on a Fred and George Weasley as comic relief. After receiving their disapparation ability, Fred and George dissaparate everywhere which makes for some fun situations.I do not want to reveal too much information for fear of spoiling it for future readers.

I don't buy that Harry pushed it out of his mind because he wanted to protect Sirius, I don't buy that Sirius didn't remind Harry about the mirror when he talked to him using Umbridge's office, and if it was such a danger why didn't someone??

I found myself thinking while I was reading, 'oh my God, Harry is growing up.' It was kinda strange. but grown up he has.I really cannot see anyone being disappointed in this. There was one problem.

I found this book to be of the standard that J.K. Rowling is known for, and definately worth the late nights that I put in finishing it.  Rowling manages to develop the main characters even further, following the trio of young wizards into their more difficult teen years, exploring relationships and dealing with heartbreak, while at the same time not having the book come off as a ""teen"" book.  Rowling also does a great job of introducing a few new characters into the story, such as ""Tonks,"" a young Auror.I remember reading in an interview somewhere that this would be a much darker book than the previous 4 volumes, and I must say that I agree.  The atmosphere created by Rowling in the magical community, the Hogwarts school and in the title character's personal life is downright dismal at times.  It made the read somewhat frustrating at times, as you WANT things to go well for the heros of the book...Rowling, however, demonstrates to the readers that this is not always the case.All in all, I thought it a good read, and would recommend it to anyone who has read the first 4 books.

In the end, Harry finds out that family is more than one normally thinks and has truly matured.Characters like Professor McGonnagill, Ginny, Fred, George, and especially Nevill shine in this story.  Harry's circle of friends grows and there are some glimpses of Harry's parrents as they were in their fifth year.

Suddenly, out of nowhere you flip the last page and you realize the whole picture has been slowly forming before your eyes without you're ever noticing.  She manages to pull together hints dropped since the very first book.  In the Order of the Phoenix Rowling lets us into some of her secrets a bit more emotionally than ever before.  We learn more about Harry's parents, Lilly and James, we also get a bit of a better understanding of Professor Snape.  It is true that Rowling kills off a major character in this book, but I believe she had her reasons for doing so.  Although bitter sweet, it's an amazing read and well worth it.I have noticed, that J.K. rowling writes each book from Harry's emotional point of view.  In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, young 11 year old Harry saw the world as black and white, good and evil.

"5331",4,731198,FALSE,"OotP is a really rich, detailed read, with a much darker tone than the pervious books.  But don't get me wrong - I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it!  I think it's an amazing continuation of the HP series.As many people have commented, Harry has changed a lot in this book.  He has a quicker temper and is much more confused & angsty.  Although I think she could have toned it down a LITTLE bit in the first half of the book, I also think that it was a good thing JK did this.  Harry's trying to deal with the events at the end of GoF, the frustration of being kept in the dark all summer, abandonment by his friends, etc ... wouldn't you want to vent your anger too?  Who hasn't ever been nasty to their siblings even without all of Harry's motivation?  I'm glad that JK wrote Harry like this - he grows and becomes more complex, and she's broken him out of the 'perfect little hero' mould once and for all.  The length of this book allows for a lot more character development - which I thought was GREAT.  It's important too, since the strength of friendship is such an important theme in this book.  We are shown that good and evil is not so black and white as before, and people such as Fred & George, Ginny, Neville, and Ron really grow.  I loved space cadette Luna Lovegood, I hope she reappears in the later books (seems likely as she's joined Harry's circle of friends).  And I thought that the Snape/James/Lily flashback was good too, interesting implications on James and Lily's relationship, no?  However, some characters, like Draco malfoy, are annoyingly the same.  Some development going on there would have been good.A lot of people have also been saying that the book was too long, that it dragged on and on, etc.  Actually, for the most part, I enjoyed reading more about Hogwarts, the HP universe, and the characters, as I've already said.  Yes, it's true that OotP contains a lot of side plots which are not crucial to the overall plot, and some are probably unnecessary.  For instance, the cleaning of Black manor and Hagrid/Grawp parts don't really have any bearing at all on the plot.  But it's always possible that all these are setting up events in forthcoming books.  It's becoming clear in this book that JK is writing in terms of the overall, rather than creating a self-contained story.  OotP is written in a much less linear fashion than any of the other books, but people, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  One major difference is that while the bulk of the book is concerned with the hateful Umbridge, she has nothing to do with the climax of the book.  This book has a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end, doesn't it? JK's writing style is branching out.  I didn't mind the length of this book, but some more editing wouldn't have weakened it either and would have pleased a lot of people by the sound of it.  If you want a cohesive plot, go straight to the masterpiece of plotting that is Prisoner of Azkaban - the way all the plots strands converge at the end of the book is fantastic.I have to say, I'm still not over the death in the book.  My favourite character and JK kills him off! [warning: slight spoiler]  Poor Harry, he just can't catch a break when it comes to family can he!  It was rather a strange death too ... there are unanswered questions there.Also, it seemed like there was less of the jokes that made books 1-4 so enjoyable and lighthearted in OotP.  Especially in the first third of the book, even when they were making jokes the people seemed slightly angry.  But well, this year was never going to be a barrelful of laughs for Harry.  Some of the scenes were truly inspired though - Fred and George's departure has to be one of my favourite HP moments!And I just have to comment on one of the main themes in the book: that of prejudice and the corruptibility/propaganda of government.

Adults may see parallels with current-events involving political corruption, power-seeking and jingoism run amok.  Children (particularly those who are near Harry's age) will probably identify more with Harry's internal battles.Lots of great new characters, many interesting developments on characters we've already met.  I can't imagine any of her fans being anything but delighted with it.Ms. Rowling keeps getting better and better with each book.  I hope the people who may have tried to rush her on this one are feeling pretty silly after seeing the result.  I can only hope that the Book 6 continues the tradition of increasing both length and depth.The closest thing to a criticism I have of this book is that it pretty much requires the reader to have already read at least books 3 and 4 to get the most enjoyment out of this one.

This is understandable as Harry is older and his feelings are more complicated.  His emotions are on a pendulum swing from sharp anger to deep insecurity, and the reader feels those emotions right along with Harry.If I had one complaint about the book, it's that Harry never seems to catch a break.  He's a walking, talking Murphy's Law.  If anything can go wrong it does.  By page 600 I was desparate for something, anything to go his way.As for the death scene(yes a major character dies), it happened so quickly as part of a battle scene, I almost didn't realize it had occurred, but Harry's reaction and subsequent working through his grief are very real and touching.All in all, I'd say that I wouldn't count it as my favorite of the five, but the Order of the Phoenix stands head and shoulders above most other books of the same genre.",FALSE,2003,1469

Well, in the case of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, that needn't be a worry. People were a little wary on just how on earth J.K. Rowling would be able to contend with the phenomenal literature she had already brought to our lives with the first four novels, but somehow, some way, she has done it again.But Harry Potter, the book and the character, isn't the same old bag of tricks that readers have become accustomed to. The likes of an innocent and sweet little boy are far gone, and replacing it is a young man, a teenager crashing into the angst of his adolescense. Harry is much angrier, much more impatient and certainly not as tolerant with his friends. The character has become that much more complex, but the development of maturity through adolscense has been so beautifully portrayed in this novel, it is hard not to enjoy every page of it. Also increasing dramatically in scope are the dangers and worries that Harry has to face. While his maturity becomes greater, so does the evil that endures. Lord Voldemort is back as we know from the previous volume, and Harry is just waiting hopelessly for Voldemort to appear one day out of thin air to sweep him off his feet and murder him. He doesn't know who to trust and he certainly doesn't find resolve in the ministry of magic, which only proves more dangerous and uncertain than anything else. But there will always be Ron and Hermione, and the moment they first appear on page, we feel that jolt of warmth that we haven't felt and have been waiting to feel for more than two years.Other characters come back as well, and Harry can find much comfort in his Godfather, Sirius, who is fleshed out in this novel to be a very enjoyable character of literature. While the fourth installment, Goblet of Fire, was a sheer display of plot, this novel is all about character study. And through these characters, we experience their pain and happiness that much more closely, due to such deep portrayals.It seems that with each book comes a rising power of darkness, maturity and adventure. While Harry becomes more mature, so does the narrative. But the enjoyment does not subsibe one bit, if not increasing. While some of the book is a slow chunk of richness, there are moments of pure brilliance that will never be forgotten, and when you've reached that last page, you will have read one of the better novels in your life. Add to the series another very magical and impressive tome. Possibly the best one yet. Welcome back, J.K. Rowling. And thank you.Jason Kramer",FALSE,2003,1475
"5339",5,731190,FALSE,"Isn't 15 just a year ahead of 14? Somehow, the latest installment of the J K Rowling seems to defy this simple math. In one year, Harry has changed a lot. He probably yelled more at his two pals, Ron and Hermione, in this book than the previous four books put together. In turn, he also gets yelled at by almost everyone, including Angelina Johnson, the new Gryffindor Captain. The reader may, at certain times, feel bored and exhausted by reading lines after lines in Caps.But this is probably in sync with Harry's world undergoing a complete paradigm shift. The hint at the end of Book 4, about the emerging tension between the Ministry of Magic and Dumbledore, didn't prepare me fully for this total onslaught on Hogwarts by Cornelius Fudge and his cronies, culminating in the arrest of Dumbledore and almost expulsion from Hogwarts for all of our near and dear characters. More than all the sinister maneuvers of you-know-who in the previous 4 books, I felt this graphic tussle to be only suitable for teenagers and not the 6-10 age group that devoured the other books. But this could be a sign of change in the Harry Potter readers as well, who, between the 4th and the 5th book, also went through the experience of September 11th, 2001, that changed their view of the world completely.The Harry Potter readers have now been accustomed to certain recurring themes. It is unlikely that the Dursleys will ever improve, though at the end of book 5, Moody threatens Vernon to treat Harry nicely or face the consequence. Harry also gets to know why Dumbledore insisted on him staying with the Dursleys everywhere.Snape also got enough chance to redeem himself but didn't seem eager to utilize them, though Harry will finally understand the reason behind Snape's intense animosity toward him.Minerva Mcgonnagal comes true as the exemplary leader of the Gryffindor house, and gains even more respect in the readers' eye than the previous books.Ron and Hermione, I am afraid, are relegated to second-string roles in this book. It is possible that Ginny and Cho Chang got more coverage. And some of the loathsome characters of the previous books make cameo appearences, including Professor Lockhart and Wormtail.But most importantly, the reader will know, once and for all, why Dumbledore is the only wizard that You-know-who is afraid about. Who else can force the Dark Lord to mutter, under excruciating pain, ""You are not going to kill me, are you?""In essence, it is a very complex book that portrays Harry's coming of age in every possible way. He discovers love; he encounters death; he faces treachery, betrayal, and downright Nazi-style torture, all within the confines of the school that he reckoned to be the most secure place. Harry will never be the same again.",FALSE,2003,1469

The Order of the Phoenix lives up to the reputation of the series.I can't say enough good things about it.  The first time I read it I raced to the end because I could not put it down.  The second time around I was able to get more from it.  And I still enjoyed every word.  (And cried at the end, again!)All I can say about the character that dies is:  no body = no death.  I guess we shall wait and see, I hope the wait is not too long, but I don't believe he is dead.  He can't be!I highly recommend the Harry Potter series to everyone, whatever your age.

Undoubtedly the best Harry Potter book (as of now because the new one's coming in a few months). Harry Potter is the next big name in  children literature. He's already world famous and it's been only a short  while since he first debuted two books ago. JK Rowling's ability to create  truly human characters is astounding. This book's characters are truly  human. I think that if you want to read a book with rich feeling and  emotion sprinkled with touches of childhood nostalgia and fantasy, this is  definately the series for you. It's a true delight to be able to realize  that such writing is still possible. The longest Harry Potter book to date,  this is my favorite. However, don't shun the first two. Each is a delight  onto itself. They're filled with suspense and adventure. I physically  laughed at the funny parts and shuddered with the fearful parts. I think  the best parts have to be the quidditch matches. I can actually feel myself  getting anxious as I read them. If you buy the first two, you'll discover  that little almost insignificant facts are explained by JK Rowling. The  fact that she connects everything makes me wonder just how much brilliance  she has. She's stuck easter eggs in every book to be explained later in the  series. These are the books to buy. If you've been saving your money to buy  a book, Harry Potter is the series that you want to buy. This book will  awake the child in you if you're five or fifty.

I was glad that I was able to finish it.I had a very hard time putting this one down. I would read until I had a headache from reading. J.K. Rowling did a phenomenal job on this one. It was very dark and foreboding but it was a great book. My brother described it as action packed at the beginning and the end with alot of talking in between. I tend to agree with him. It was essential that it be that way though. While at Hogwarts, we learned more about Harry becoming a teenager. As for the rest of the characters, we learned more about their personalities. I was in awe at the beginning when Ron was named a prefect. Then it was explained at the end as to why he was. It makes you wonder if Harry might in book seven be named, Head Boy. I just have a feeling that Draco and Hermoine will be Head Boy and Head Girl. I do not think that Dumbledore will do that to Hogwarts though. I mean could you imagine a Slytherin as a Head Boy especially after this book. Then again, the series is full of twists around every corner.The Order of the Phoenix definitely moves the series from a children's book to an adult book as it should with Harry becoming of age. I was glad to see the use of the other students in this book. I am curious to see how long the movie for this book might end up being. There is not much that can really be taken out and still keep the story line.The long answered question of who dies was definitely one of great surprise. I cheated, like many did I am sure, of finding out who was killed off. There was so much talk over who would die and who was suspected to die. Let's put it this way, characters that you met in the first book are safe. Yes, I am sure that there is one or two that you wish would just go away.As for the ministry of magic, they take a much more active life in Hogwart's this book. You learn to hate one character in particular. You are introduced to more students. I was very glad to hear that the ministry of magic was ""set straight"" on their feelings of Lord Voldemort being alive. I kept calling the one ministry of magic at the school a few names that best described the person.All in all, it was well worth the wait.

I didn't want the book to end-but at the same time, I was rushing through it, to see what happened at the end.Every morning I would wake up, run downstairs, pick up the book, take a break for eating, and didn't stop until it was time to go to bed again. That went on for 3 days, until I finished it. I told my mom, ""tell them I'm busy,"" when my friends called.I've always been a fan of Harry Potter, since I was little...just like all the kids in America and England, I suppose. I was eagerly awaiting this one. I wasn't let down in the slightest. I knew that it had to be pretty good if we had to wait 3 years for it...and it was. It was better than ""pretty good.""Sometimes I had to scold myself for rushing through the sentances, since I kept wanting to see what happened next, and I actually made myself go back and really read them, and I thought, I'm glad I did that...Rowling has a way of making a simple sentance really magical. She's the best author that I've seen yet. How she comes up with all these ideas, how the ends of the books always make you go ""OH MY GOSH"", ""NO SIR"", etc, and leave you wondering, she always explains everything (in this case, someone explaining it all to Harry) and leaves you satisfied at the end. But wanting more. Yes, she's good at teasing us...leaving us wanting more. I know I want more, and my next question is...when's the 6th book coming out?Harry was quite a smart-alleck this year, too. I loved that. He's got great one liners, and he's sorta got an attitude problem, doesn't he? I thought that was cute, though. How could he NOT be bitter, after his stay at the Dursley's, and also getting so frustrated with Ron, Hermione, and Sirius, just saying things like ""hope you're well"" in their letters.But he met with them soon enough, and that was a relief. He goes through many adventures in the end...and though he might not talk much, he really has feelings. A whole lot of them, as we realize at the end, with his vision in the Department of Mysteries.I actually become one with the charactors, I AM at Hogwarts, I do go to the classes.

I couldn't put it down, it was addicting, but I think that was just because it was a Harry Potter book, so it has to be adicting even if it stinks.  I liked this book, but I don't think JK Rowling had the charm she put into the others.  On the fourth one, she was truley at her height and I think being pressured to keep that standard has made her freak and so, I don't know, this book just isn't that great.  Alot of little things happen that make you gain intrest, but they aren't really that important and you sort of get sick of them.  There is no fantastic action when your ready for it.  All the action comes at the end of the book, and to tell you the truth, I HATED the end.  It depressed me so much I cried, and I just wasn't all that crazy about it.  I liked the book, but it was average, and i think the author could do better.  I HATE THE END!!!!!  I don't think that was the right way to end it.

"5350",4,731194,FALSE,"While each Harry Potter book of the series tries to play out as its own episode, it's easy to see the series as one whole story.  Structured very much like a five act greek play, the first book provided us with an introduction to our characters and world.  The second and third book were the rising action, book two providing our back story and book three leading towards are climax, book four.  Goblet of Fire had the most interesting premise, the Triwizard tournment and lead to the climax of the entire series, the return of Voldemort.  Book five, and probably book six fall under descending action.  After the climax, there is no more mystery.  We all know Voldemort is back and will continue to do evil, which is just what he does in book five.  Order of the Phoenix tries to be clever by providing us with answers such as Harry having to defeat Voldemort, but I think most of us figured that out in book one.  Book five's purpose is to heighten the tension.  Things begin to spiral out of control and probably will do the same in book six.  What we are all really waiting for since book four is the last chapter of the series, book seven and the final confrontation between protagonist and antagonist.  Do we really have to wait another three years for book six?  No, we didn't need to wait three years for book five, we don't need to wait for book six, what we are really waiting for is book seven.

Quidditch is BACK, and the coming of age love is story between (SPOILER ALERT!) Cho and Harry is just plain adorable...although it could have ended better.  And the spark of love between Ron and Hermione hinted at the fourth book (and second movie), which was one of my most anticipated moment in this chapter, was never fully touched upon (save for one scene before Ron's quidditch match...WAFF...).(END SPOILER)  Still, there were a lot of very powerful, poignant, suprising, and emotional moments enough for TWO books which are truly unforgettable.  Dumbledore has never given a more touching (not to mention completely satisfying and revealing)speech towards Harry, the action is fierce(SPOILER)(Dumbledore VS.

"5354",4,731190,FALSE,"When you think about it, JK Rowling could hardly have gone any other way.  A brilliant writer and storyteller (as this book wholeheartedly proves), she has taken the Harry Potter series along a natural route, following the growth and development of her characters in realistic terms that anybody can relate with.Forget the absurdity of magic for a moment.  What would really happen to a boy like Harry, having faced what he's faced and seen what he's seen while also growing up from a simple boy of 11 in the first book to a developing 15 at the opening of Order of the Phoenix?  This is the Boy Who Survived, not just once but FIVE TIMES now the wrath of Voldemort (counting his experience as a baby), even before this book begins.Like any 15 year old, Harry can't understand why the grown ups don't trust him.  He's the one that survived - not them.  He's the one that beat Voldemort - not them.  Even Ron and Hermione, while contributing players in all four previous books, cannot relate to what he's seen.And, so, in this book, we see Harry grow distant.  Uncomfortable.  Angry.  Hormonal.  Or, to simplify . . . he turns 15.  And JK Rowling has brilliantly stacked the deck against his raging growth hormones, setting even his two best friends and Dumbledore in opposite corners from him, forcing Harry to all-to-often go at the process of growing up alone.  This absence of those he's come to depend on, those who are growing up on their own and becoming oh-so-subteley different from Harry, makes his new adventures even more profound.  And real.Now - Is this all good?  The Order of the Phoenix is brilliantly written, I'll give you that.  JK Rowling knows where she wants this story to go, and has successfully plotted a new direction for the series (growing older with her audience, if you will).But while I admire this progression, I for one miss the innocence of the first three books (much as many parents might miss the innocence of their own 11 year-olds).  I liked the trifecta of problem solvers in those books, the progression of the riddle as more and more clues were unfurled.  For the first time in Book 5, I found the other characters in the story more interesting than Harry.  I wanted more of Hermione and Ron, more Dumbledore and Hagrid, and wished they would have been able to settle Harry's growing anger so they could all get back to work.Brilliant book - but here's hoping Harry rejoins the lighter side in Book 6 and makes me smile a little more.",FALSE,2003,1469
"5359",4,731189,FALSE,"I won't waste place for summaries of the book - it's been done here already. Mostly I'd like to share my impressions:Firstly, I gave the book four stars, as you can see. It's entertaining, clever, well written, generally what a good book should be. It isn't perhaps a masterpiece, but among Harry Potter books I'd give it second place (the first belonging still to The Prisoner Of Azkaban). It's frighteningly long - at this rate I expect 7th part to be sold in two or three books - but the reading is smooth enough. (I finished in two days, so you can imagine).Next thing is the actual plot. In my opinion it was a lot more predictable than the other four. The one thing I was not expecting is the thing I'd gladly skin Joanne Rowling for. (No offence meant. I just dislike her choice of character to kill off). I wasn't really surprised with the action turning out as it did, the mysterious dreams Harry had are quite see-through.Characters are developing nicely. I was quite surprised to see that Harry's has finally grown up some - not necessarily in a good way. But he is a tad more believable now. I'd say I like the new Harry, he is slightly arrogant and rebellious, but it's all for the better. Hermione is still obsessed with her studies (with OWLs coming on), Ginny and Neville are positively great. Ron didn't change all that much. (It's okay as I don't like him really).Me and my sister have developed a theory about the Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher: their main characteristics are in a pattern: first there was a disguised bad guy, then an idiot, then a competent and nice teacher, then a disguised bad guy again... So far the theory is proving right.As I mentioned before, I was greatly disappointed with the famous death scene. I think it should have been someone else, not giving any names of course. And nobody explained what actually happened with the person's body, so I expect more details on that in the next part. I might seem a little biased, but I kindly ask for forgiveness, since it was my favourite character who was murdered.To conclude matters - I think that it was a decent continuation of the previous books (although I still believe that the third book is the best), maybe it lost some of it's surprising contents. For example, Dumbledore's revelations weren't at all unpredictable, I suspected as much for a long time, and I wasn't alone either.

"5360",5,731189,FALSE,"In the three years since ""Goblet of Fire"" was published, Potter fans have had lots of time to muse over certain inconsistencies in Rowling's enchanted world.  Why do some wizards move on after death, while others remain as ghosts or reside in picture frames?  If the Dursleys hate Harry so much, why do they still take him in every summer?  Finally, why would Lord Voldemort care about killing baby Harry in the first place?Rowling provides answers for these mysteries and more in ""The Order of the Phoenix.""  Of course, she also raises more questions to keep readers hungry for the next installment.Events in the fifth novel escalate, but are actually more believable than the Triwizard tournament of the fourth novel.  Characters become less sterotyped as good and bad.  Even saintly Dumbledore turns out to make mistakes.  Harry, of course, has to deal with typical adolescent mood swings in addition to worrying about you-know-who.  These developments are refreshing, and bode well for the remaining two books.Rowling remains in fine form despite the delay in producing book five.

"5361",4,731190,FALSE,"While reading the longest ""children's"" book in history over the first weekend it was available to the public, I couldn't help but have my attention drawn back to one of my favorite films, The Empire Strikes Back.A bold comparison, you say?  I think not.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is dark, about a boy who is angry at everyone because of issues he feels have been forced upon him, and doesn't have the happy ending that we have all come to expect from our entertainment industry.But these reasons and so many more, are why this is a wonderful book.First let me say that I appreciate that the author seems to respect her readers (people under 25) that are growing into her books.  If you read the first book, it seems to be written to an 11 year-old.  However, as Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown, so has Ms. Rowling's voice in her books.  This book is written for a 15 year-old.  I appreciate that she realizes that we, her audience, are growing as Harry grows, and because of that, she is increasing our potential reading level.  That must be the teacher in her.The action begins very quickly, in the first few pages to be exact, and the book really doesn't slow down from there.  Admittedly, I was disappointed in some of the ""regular"" items that have become my favorite being gone this time around: there is no Halloween Feast mentioned, Quidditch is a second thought, and I still don't know who won the House Cup.  But there are lots of other things to keep you going, not to mention that by the end of the book, those things have become so trivial, you feel ashamed slightly, that you missed them.The introduction of new characters to the story was done well, I think I have a new favorite (besides Harry), and the death of a ""major character"" was done in as tastefull a manner as possible.  Be prepared to cry here, I did.All in all, it was a good read.  I read it aloud to my family, and we finished it in under 2 days.  (I'm now reading it again, in case I missed something!)I would warn some, this book is much darker than the previous four.  My son had to sit in my husband's lap during some of the fighting scenes.Ms. Rowling has done an excellent job with the most recent installment of the wildly popular series.

"5362",4,731205,FALSE,"First off, let me say that I am nearly 30 years old, an avid reader, and I love Harry Potter.  J.K. Rowling has a wonderful style that makes it easy to emmerse yourself in the world of witchcraft and wizardry.  So often when I read fantasy books such as these, it becomes difficult to identify with the characters and the world the author presents.  Thankfully, Ms. Rowling does not fall into that trap, and I think its because the series is not a fantasy story, its a coming of age story that happens to be set in a fantasy world.  Ms. Rowling does an excellent job of never letting the reader forget that this is a story about Harry, not about Magic.  Similarly, she keeps the readers in mind:  as Harry grows, so do the books.  They become longer, more complex, even darker, as the readers who began reading the books at a young age will be able to keep reading and identify with Harry as he grows to adulthood.With that said, this book was not as well written as it could have been, given the time it took to write, and especially when it is compared to the other books in the series.  There were also a couple of plot elements which went unexplored, though I'm sure that Ms. Rowling has plans for them in the future.  The climax, too, left me a bit unsatisfied; I wanted more to happen, and a better explaination of the events which occurred than what was offered.Now for the good parts.  It is true that the narrative is a bit slow in the beginning, but I think it sets the right tone for Harry's mood to begin the book.  Most of the criticisms that I have read have also mentioned how whiny and unpredictable Harry is, but I remember when I was 15, and Harry's behavior is very familiar.  Ms. Rowling keeps the story about Harry and the growing pains which come with adolescence.  Finally, the whole of the story, the back plots and what not, are truly gripping; for example the confusion that Harry feels when he finds out what his father had been like at his age was wonderfully done.All in all, Order of the Phoenix is a great read, and the critiques I listed above did not interfere with my enjoyment of the book.  I recommend this book, but I do suggest reading the rest in the series first.  It adds more to the readers' understanding of the back story and references made throughout the book.

"5364",5,731189,FALSE,"Well, I have to say that once more I have been amply impressed by Rowling's genius.  This newest installation is much deeper, darker, and more mysterious than the first four.  Yes, I was one of those who waited on line at midnight and stayed up reading to the wee hours of the morning.  I could not rest until I finished the book.  Rowling, as she always does, kept me anticipating, guessing, hoping, and dreading.  The book starts out a tad slowly, but, of course, it is also very interesting.  By, oh, I'd say the 450th page it really begins to pick up...  The frustration I felt at not knowing the answers to the multitude of questions that kept racing through my mind was well rewarded in time, and by the end of the book I was quite satisfied.  Finally, we, the followers of this magical world, are given answers to questions we have long asked of everyone who has read the book.  As I do not want to give away what happens in this wonderful book, I will only give a general atmosphere that surrounds its content.  Yes, it is darker.  The whole wizarding world must realize what it is dealing with.  It is mysterious.  Until the end of the book, you are left groping for answers in dire suspense.  Of course, the humor that threads through all of the Harry Potter books is present in the fifth book as well.  The characters become deeper - more of them is revealed, and their different natures become more distinct.  As much joy as I felt reading the book, I left it with mixed feelings of happiness and depression, for, as it is true to real life, all things do not turn out satisfactory in the end.  All in all, for you Harry Potter fans out there, do not become disgruntled at seeing 870 pages stare you in the face.  It goes rather quickly - too quickly in my opinion (maybe Rowling will keep on the doubling track and make the sixth book 1700 pages long) - and it is well worth reading.  As for those of you who are not Harry Potter fans, I sincerely suggest you become fans - and quickly, for this book is sure to become a topic of hot discussion and debate all over.  The book in one sentence:  Harry Potter's life is in danger (as usual), he goes to Hogwarts and deals with the trials of school, fights widely circulating lies and rumors about him, encounters bigger problems than his O.W.L. exams, and has to learn to cope with more loss (in a variety of areas).

Harry Potter finds himself in yet another dangerous situation, with a ""mad"", dark wizard after him, gloomy dementors roaming the Hogwarts campus, and seeing the symbol for death, the Grim, almost everywhere he goes. Although it is expected to see such ingredients in a Harry Potter recipe, it was not expected to find Rowling's dash of symbolism the major source of flavor. It might be said that such a book like Harry Potter, with it's lazer pointed right at the second grade clubhouse, isn't meant to be interpreted in such a way and that these descriptions are meant to spark ""the kids'"" imaginations. Well, as a young adult, the symbolism shown to me was clear and usefull. First of all, the man who makes the story, Sirius Black. Sirius Black is a Animagus and changes into a black dog. The black dog shows itself to be a symbol for strength and an inner devil. Sirius ""Black"" also composes himself in a symbolic way. He hides in the shadows, which, it seems to be, a symbol for guilt. Another symbolic character, if that's what you want to call them, is the dementors. Always in a group and always hiding their faces, the dementors symbolize an always present conscience. Always bringing the memory of Harry's parents, they symbolize the conscience of Sirius Black and the conscience of Harry Potter. For Sirius, they are a constant reminder of his drastic mistake that resulted in the death of Harry's parents. For Harry, they bring an inner urge to be reunited with his parents and the presence of Lord Voldemort, that is always lurking in the back of his head. Harry's reaction to the dementors represents the overpowering effect of the death of his parent's, which Harry always chooses to hide. When thinking of hiding, only one character comes to mind, the infamous Scabbers, or known to many as Peter Pettigrew. Peter, being an animagus also, changes into a rat. This represents his true personality and his cheating, manipulative charActeristics. So, it is shown that Rowling uses animal's to symbolize the personality's of the characters. She also uses the scaly appearance and purpose of the dementors to symbolize the darker aspect, Lord Voldemort and the death of Harry's Parent's.  Did the usage of symbolism really make that big of difference? Many would say yes. The use of this literary device brings the novel out of the shadows of the kids story corner and into the limelight of the adult non-fiction section. The more mature tone and plot is appreciated, will hopefully continue.",FALSE,2002,1057

He mulls over many details, and is prone to frequent outbursts. When he is not made prefect, he thinks about it, and almost condemns Ron (you'll find out why)and others.Harry is also plaugued by dreams that seem to connect him and voldemort. The dreams happen when the actual act is happening...he is transported into voldemort's body, he can hear his thoughts, and sees the action as it happens...he becomes a sort of alert. But this turns out badly for him in the end.The new DADA teacher is so awful, you want to jump in the book and strangle her. that goes for that dear old minister of magic, Cornelius Fudge, as well.Personally, I think some of the best parts in the book happen because of dumbledore. he gets harry out of a few jams, and I seriously was astounded by the brilliance of the plans he had.This book, in short, is fantastic.",FALSE,2003,1470

This book, by far the longest book in the series (870 pages) is also definately the best.  I got this book June 21 and could not put it down, finishing it the following day (June 22).This book, similar to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes the time to go into detail of events on Harry's summer, and not just at Hogwarts.  Harry Potter will finally learn why Lord Voldemort came after him in the first place, and readers will learn of a startling prophecy made by someone you would not expect.  This book has layers upon layers, yet can be understood on a simple level by young readers.  J.K. Rowling has taken the wizarding world and added yet another wonderful addition to our favorite collection of books.DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE GIVEN A FEW DETAILS OF THE BOOKDuring an uneventful summer, Harry Potter suddenly is attacked by two dementors, barely escaping with his corpeal patronus.  He then is rescued by his ""guardians"" from the Order of Phoenix, and winds up going back to the house of Sirius Black.

I knew a character was going to die by the end, but I was never able to guess who it was going to be.  It will be a surprise to the reader.

"5373",5,731191,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix is without a doubt, my favorite of the series so far (I finished reading it within 24 hours of purchase - all 870 pages).  All of the enjoyable traits of the previous Potter books remain, the enchanted world and its creatures, further explaining the events that lead to the current state of the wizarding world, the introduction of new spells and magical disciplines, quidditch and the house cup, and a fair amount of humor (although less than previous books.) Rowling's talent for creating characters we can all identify with continues to abound, particularly with the introduction of a detestable character known as Madame Umbridge.  However, the most impressive aspects of Rowling's latest work are the morality lessons, and Rowling's ability to capture the angst of adolescence.Voldemort and his death eaters have intolerance for `mudbloods' and their subsequent quest to rid the world of them are reminiscent of Nazi Germany especially when you consider that Voldemort himself is a mudblood.  Madame Umbridge's subversive work is despicable, and bears a striking resemblance to Orwell's Animal Farm.  These well-written antagonists and their actions towards our hero are the steepest challenges Harry and his gang has yet to face, especially given the turmoil that is a 15 year olds world.Perhaps the most enjoyable arc of the plot is the different characters coming to grips with growing up.  Rowling does a tremendous job capturing the distraught feelings of a teen, from awkwardness and chest puffing in front of a girl, to anger, confusion and a sense of cockiness.  She puts Potter through the emotional wringer, and like all teens, he is thoroughly confused.  The beauty of her work here is the poignancy to it.  Harry does not understand, and does not want to.  If growing up is painful, if being a world famous wizard is painful, than he will take his leave, thank you.  The key is, the reader is so immersed into Harry's world that it is difficult not to feel what he is feeling, and this emotional ride that Rowling takes us on has more peaks and valleys than any of her other works.Fast paced, fun, and emotionally introspective, The Order of the Phoenix satisfies like none so far, but again leaves the reader counting down the days to the release of Year 6.  I cannot wait.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5374",5,731188,FALSE,"The 5th Harry Potter Book is definitely the best one yet. As soon as I started reading it I was sucked into the story and I could not stop until I had finished. I started reading the book at about 5pm on Saturday (I would have started sooner but I knew that I wouldn't be able to put it down until I finished it and I thought I'd better do some of the homework I had). I read it everywhere, and kept reading through dinner. Nine and a half hours later I'd finished it: at 2:38am.Harry starts off in a flowerbed outside Number Four, Privet Drive on a hot summer's evening, but by the end of the book he has seen and done much more than that. Throughout the year he encounters (and has to somehow endure) everything from Giants, to Centaurs to Professor Umbridge (hem hem). He has to sit the gruelling OWL examinations, sit detentions with Professor Umbridge, still face up to Potions lesson with Snape and consider his future after Hogwarts. Not far into the year the school is thrown into chaos and as time goes on it gets steadily worse.Harry strives to tell the truth about what happened at the TriWizard Tournament in the last book but there is a shadow of disbelief cast over the Wizarding World and hardly anyone believes him. He sets up DA and for much of the year this is what keeps the light in his world. At the end of the book Harry discovers the truth, but not until he has witnessed the death of one of his closest friends.JK Rowling continues to develop her characters in the fifth book. They grow, change and mature throughout the novel. Harry becomes increasingly angry as his Fifth year at Hogwarts continues, there is rarely a time when his scar does not hurt and his dreams become more than just dreams.For those worrying that the book will not be as good as the others there is no disappointment. The novel lives us to all expectations. The plot is even more detailed and intricate than the fourth book and the characters are full of life. The only question that I have now is, how long until the sixth book will be finished and released?",FALSE,2003,1467
"5378",5,731190,FALSE,"I found Rowling's latest book deeply satisfying. I have been reading the book almost non-stop since buying it midnight on Friday. I won't give away any particulars as to who dies or what happens, but I will say there is something so great about Harry being a tortured adolescent. His sense of alienation, his fits of anger, his awkward foray into the dating world, makes this volume more akin to say CATCHER IN THE RYE except of course this is a plot driven book.  I also liked Rowling's attention to detail we learn more about St. Mungo's hospital where Neville's parents are kept and yes, Hagrid has yet another dangerous, but surprising creature in his lair.  There is a perfectly officious and pyschotic new administrator aptly named Miss Umbridge who reminded me of one hellish nun who taught me in high school.  But where Rowling I think thrives, is creating personal relationships.  I find Harry's relationship with the weasley's endearing and his relationship with Sirrus Black becomes more complicated, but in effect richer.  This is not to say this book is without humor, Fred and George keep hellish Miss Umbridge on her toes and the endless list of decrees set by the aforementioned are funny and infuritating. As an adult reader of Rowling and one who got up at midnight and waited in line at the new Borders (rebuilt and relocated after the one in the world trade center fell), to watch all the kids with their parents dressed up and excited, I felt as though I was on the Hogwarts Express waiting the sweet cart to come around.  Perfect summer reading!",FALSE,2003,1469
"5379",4,731914,FALSE,"The 5th Harry Potter Book was good-yet did not measure up to the first four for these reasons:a. Harry was real whiny! Where did our adoriable little boy go?  What made Harry so likeable in the first four books were his sweetness- and slight sarcasm.  He was funny, natural, and seemed like the kid next door that you could talk to, yet might tease you lightly.  Now Harry has really become a teenager (his years as 13 and 14 were just prelimainary), and a cranky, irrating, sharp, smart-mouthed one at that.  I do understand what he was going through, and how it must have been twice as hard, as half the wizarding world think he's nuts, and he doesn't have any parents, yet I wish that he would cut out the drama- and now I really do understand what my parents must go through everyday.  In this book Harry additude was just to-hellish.b.  The length. Now, I am no stranger to long books-I have read books longer than the Harry Potter books (people must remeber that they are double spaced, and in big font), yet the irrating thing about the lenght of this particualar book was that a lot of it were totally uneccesary-it seemed like JK didn't want to diassapoint fans with a short book, so added a lot of unneccesary points to this book.  In fact, the first and the last couple chapters were all you needed to be perfectly set for the next book(which I am waiting for feverently!)Now for the GOOD POINTS!a.  It's a Harry Potter book!  That in itself makes it great-one thing I like about these books is that you can always expect a book which is a joy to read over and over again.b.  The other characters remained the same.  Even though JK gave Harry a makeover, she wisely refrained from changing the other characters personality(though to be fair, Harry is the youngest of Ron and Hermione, which accounts for a bit of maturity)c. suspense.  JK captures the element of suspense perfectly-which helped save this book.  You wanted to keep reading(even if the part you were on was a bit dull) to find out what would happen next.d. Humor.  JK knows that what makes her books so enjoyable is that their the complete package-which includes humor.  She nevers forgets to add in quirky, funny moments which make the book really enjoyable.e.  Ties up lose ends.  Harry is growing up, and this book gently shows us that the time is drawing nearer for Harry to meet Voldermort.

The characters are growing up and becoming more realistic- Harry Potter with teen angst!  He's not always perfect, but more likeable now that he seems more real.  Ron takes less of a sidekick role in this book, as does Hermione.  My only complaint is that if the good guys are going to have their not-so-perfect aspects shown, perhaps it's time that we see that not all of the ""bad guys"" are 100% pure evil, except for Voldemort of course.  The new defense against dark arts teacher is easy to hate, but hard to believe.  Draco is as evil as ever, as are his cronies.  The much talked about death in the book was a bit predictable, and I'm not sure why there were tears shed by the author because of it.  In light of my small complaints, I will just say that this book was incredibly enjoyable, and I am already eagerly awaiting book 6.

"5387",5,731196,FALSE,"Rowling's latest installment in the Harry Potter series is head and shoulders above the other 4 Harry Potter books.  Prior to the release of this book, I wasn't to excited about the book.  However, whenever I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  Rowling incorporates all of the books into this one, which makes it great and more exciting.  The thing that Harry Potter fans are getting wrong is the fact that this is a continuing story, not just a bunch of books that are about each year at Hogwarts.This book is by far the best Harry Potter book that's been published yet, because i dives deeper into the minds of those who want to kill Harry.  It answers old questions, but it also brings up new ones.  Each new book in this series gets darker and darker as you learn the truth to the past, present, and possibly future.I can not commend J.K. Rowling enough for this book.  It is truly a masterpiece.  Though it is about a hundred pages longer than The Goblet of Fire, it is for good reasons.  You can expect humor, satire, action, adventure, courage, hate, and love from this book.  Rowling describes many situations in detail, but doesn't over describe something.  Also, she never underdescribes a situation in the book either.  Everything important is given the proper attention, while everything that isn't is left out of the book.The book reveals a lot about Harry's character and it's relationship with his dead father.  Also, it discusses the unknown relationship that existed between James Potter (Harry's father), Professor Snape, and Harry.  Rowling allows these characters to grow and shape into a new person.  Even Harry's father, James (who is dead), is allowed to change his character over the course of the book.  Harry's understanding of his father changes the way he looks at himself.Harry Potter fans will be delighted about this book.  The reader get immersed into a different world that on the surface seems harmless and interesting.  However, you learn that it is like our own, corrupt and full of evil.

"5390",5,731188,FALSE,"Wow is the only word I can use to describe this book.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is like no other book in the Harry Potter series.  Not everything is black and white, in fact, a gray aura seems to hang over the book.  It's much more depressing.  I came off of the other books with a grin on my face, even when Voldemort came back during the fourth book.  Not so here.Harry Potter is no longer a child's book.  Harry has his first kiss (not with Hermione! HA!), but that isn't the only thing that makes this book so difficult and at times painful to read.  I started reading the Harry Potter books as a preteen, and I enjoyed them as a fluffy, fun escape from the real world.  Book five isn't fun.  It isn't fluffy.  But it's amazing.Harry is angry.  He's angry at his friends, angry at his pseudo-family, angry at anyone who tries to help him.  It's a mix of puberty (I should know), depression, and fear of hurting those who are near him.The trio, while not falling apart, is becoming less and less part of Harry's life.  Ron and Hermione are still his best friends, and probably always will be, but it's changed.  Not in a bad way, just in a different way.The new character rock.  The new DADA teacher makes Snape look like Santa Claus, and you meet some really cool aurors, such as Tonks, a punk!  Ginny FINALLY has some lines, and she is the coolest.  She is the witch version of myself--headstrong, a prankster (not as bad as Fred and George), sweet, and dating other boys.  She's moved on from Harry, which is nice, but I think it won't last.  When Harry starts to show some interest in her in Book 6 or 7, she'll come around.Jo promised a heartbreaking death in this book, and she delivers.  It's the most painful (emotionally) death I've ever witnessed in any form of art...but to say more would give too much away.

"5391",5,731890,FALSE,"Let me start off by saying that I think it's absolutely wonderful that there are so many reviews of this book by children and teenagers here at Amazon - that just shows that the Harry Potter series has generated incredible amounts of interest in our children to read again, much like the Tolkien ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and CS Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series did a generation ago.  In this world of PlayStations, MTV, and, yes, instant messaging, it's a welcome (and long-overdue) breath of fresh air.However, that also explains the real dichotomy of opinion regarding the Order of the Phoenix.  Many of the reviewers who are passionate in their dislike about the book are those that have not yet been through the teen angst that Harry is experiencing (remember, all of these books, and especially this one, look at the world through Harry's eyes), or they are going through it themselves and it may be hitting just a little too close to home for comfort.  Both of these perspectives are quite valid ones, and just further illustrate why the Potter series has been wildly successful - people see these characters as not only realistic (truly a great accomplishment for a fantasy book series, BTW), but relatable as well.People must realize that in this book, the fifth of a seven-book series, Harry must have all of his worldview questioned and torn down, in a sense, so that he can be ready for the final, climactic battle with Voldemort that is sure to follow in one of the last two novels.  The old adage, ""what doesn't kill you will make you stronger,"" certainly applies to this novel.  Harry doesn't know who, or what, to trust or believe in - from the authorities at the Ministry of Magic (who certainly do NOT trust him), to his birth and surrogate parents (in the first fifteen pages of the book, we learn all sorts of revelations about Aunt Petunia's true relationship with her sister Lily, Harry's mother), to even Professor Dumbledore (who Harry believes is hiding something from him - and he's right).  His entire world, from his ties to his surrogate family on 4 Privet Drive, to his friendships with Ron and Hermione and Hagrid, to his romance(?) with Cho, to his place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, is turned upside down and muddled.  And as a backdrop to all of this, he is learning a lot of terrifying things about just how closely he is inextricably tied to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.""Order of the Phoenix"" may just be the most psychologically challenging novel of all of the series (""Azkaban"" may be the only other novel that comes close), and thus may be the most mature novel of the series as well.  But, again, this also makes sense, because Harry is also maturing, and we are with him.  In this context, it makes perfect sense for this novel to be the longest, and most complex, of the entire series to date.  I, for one, cannot wait for ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" to come out and shed even more light on Harry's transformation into the great wizard he was born to be.",FALSE,2005,2169
"5392",5,731192,FALSE,"I read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix having enjoyed the last four in the series.  I enjoyed this book as well.This book takes place (of course) in Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry.  He is now 15 years old and is maturing as a wizard and as a person.  Ms. Rowling realistically portrays Harry's maturing process, his self examination and the pain inherent in growing up.  Harry must face embarrassment, ridicule and disillusionment with one's heroes (he finds out that both his father and Dumbledore are/were fallible human beings).  Harry and his friends deal with the normal problems of secondary school: crushing homework, impossible exams, unfair teachers while at the same time they face the return of Lord Voldemort and the increasingly shrill and harsh regime of the Ministry of Magic, whose leaders refuse to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned.J.K. Rowling continues her masterful story telling using her steady, readable prose and by weaving tidbits of seeming irrelevance into the fabric of her plot line, revealing each as an important clue into later occurrences.  It is a very well written book which conforms to Ms. Rowling's now familiar writing formula.Parents should be warned.  This is not a book for small children.  I would not let my eight-year-old read it until she could understand some of the more subtle, dark themes.  Continuous trife, the threat of violence and death are much more frequent in this book than in the previous Potter books.  Also, teenage (ok, maybe pre-teen) issues of romance, guilt, self doubt and self-discovery are on a more mature level than before.Ms. Rowling reveals a teenager in The Order of the Phoenix. Like most people, Harry Potter is harder to live with as a teen than he was as a child.  He is self-absorbed, prone to moodiness, sulleness and to depression.  He throws temper tantrums at regular intervals and lashes out at friends, teachers and parental figures alike.In the end, Harry Potter and Ms. Rowling's book remain sympathetic and likable, if more complex and three dimensional than before. A great read.",FALSE,2003,1471
"5394",5,731921,FALSE,"This is a very difficult book for me to read.  While it does advance the story arc and realistically presents the 15-year-olds, the introduction of the political aspects of society too closely parallels the United States in the early 21st Century.

Ms. Rowling does her Swiftian best holding up the mirror while remaining true to the context in which she's writing.High Inquisitor Umbridge, the microcosm's John Ashcroft, Tom Ridge, and Alberto Gonzales, frightens and appalls me.

Even  better, the Potter series emphasizes the importance of friendship, loyalty,  and courage that elevate her books far above mere adventure stories.

"5396",2,731242,FALSE,"Let me start off by saying that I do understand that many Christians will not read the Harry Potter series. The magic in the book tends to offend some people. I do not feel this way. I understand that the magic in these books is pure fantasy. As a very wise friend of mine once said, ""You can wave a stick around all you want, but it isn't going to do magic."" Baring this in mind, I am going to review this book from a literary and family-friendly standpoint. Unfortunately, the book tends to fall short on these two ideas, anyway.RELIGIOUS//POSITIVE CONTENT: Harry and his friends are devoted to each other. Despite Harry's constant moodiness (which became annoying quickly), they still stand by him. One character even risks being an outlaw in order to keep Harry out of trouble, by taking the blame for something that the title character has done. Characters, on more than one occasion, risk their lives for one another. Even nasty Professor Snape has chosen the good side, though this doesn't help his disposition.The only thing that alludes to religion in the book, other than the Death Eaters' insane devotion to and . . . indeed, worship of . . . Voldemort, is the comparison of a couple of buildings to churches.ADULT LANGUAGE/CONTENT: Several characters, mostly young teenagers, swear. They words are minor, but still do not belong in a book that is marketed to children.Two characters are treated badly by their peers. One of them doesn't appear bothered by it. However, we get the feeling that the tormenting of the other has resulted partly in his foul personality.Fred and George, Ron's older, twin brothers, are constantly disruptive and disobedient. They collect items that are illegal, completely disobeying their mother. They torment an authority figure. While this particular person is not exactly the nicest person, this could still give impressionable youth a bad message. To top it off, they drop out of school during what is the equivalent of their senior year so that they can open a joke shop. Once we see how well they are doing with this shop, we realize that the author has glamorized their actions. Is that the kind of message that we want to send to the children who are likely to read this . . . That we don't have to take school seriously?One character actually removes his eye.VIOLENT CONTENT: Mostly bloodless. People are blasted by with magic, which seems to take on the appearance of a laser gun battle from a science fiction movie. One beloved character, probably my favorite in the entire series . . . on a personal note, comes to Harry's rescue and, in the ensuing battle, makes the ultimate sacrifice. Ron is attacked by a disembodied brain. One man's head is magically shrunk into that of an infant.In a particularly disturbing punishment, Harry is made . . . by a teacher . . . to write, ""I must not tell lies,"" despite having told no falsehoods. The pen with which he writes the lines magically CARVES THE WORDS INTO THE BACK OF HIS HAND AS THEY ARE PUT ON THE PAPER. Though they immediately heal at first, they become longer lasting the more he writes. The author describes the pen's wounds in all their bloody glory. And I used to think that it was bad for my mother to make me stand in the corner.CONCLUSION: The maturity level of the Harry Potter books really increased in The Goblet of Fire. This book continues that trend. Whether or not you have allowed your children to read about Harry Potter's adventures in the past, one thing is for certain . . . The Order of the Phoenix is not a children's book. Adults, who are mature enough to know that the magic is fantasy and that it is NEVER a good idea to drop out of school, may enjoy it. Just keep it away from the kids.",FALSE,2003,1521
"5397",5,731193,FALSE,"Since ""Sorcerer's Stone"", J. K. Rowling has continually delivered perhaps what will grow to be the greatest fantasy epic of our generation and despite a 3-year hiatus, she, along with Harry and all of his wizarding world, are BACK!!!.Though, I feel it is not the greatest chapter so far in the series (it tended to get tedious and long at parts), it is still a great book! The ending is quite unfortunate and makes you resent the author for writing the murder of a character that we've grown to adore. A great bulk of the book (say...pages 1-750) are unnecessary and the real ""action"" doesn't start until the last 100 or so pages.However, readers will find themselves racing across the pages and once again find themselves glued to Rowling's every words as Harry finds himself again face-to-face in a confrontation with the one he fears the most, the returned Lord Voldemort. Though, this battle is not as epic as exhilarating as the one Harry has at the end of last term (Goblet of Fire), readers will find countless other things about this book that will keep them reading though all 870 pages.I personally loved the return of many characters from previous books including: the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, Dobby, Cho Chang (things really heat up between her and Harry in this book!), the ever-gossipy Rita Skeeter, and many more characters.As have in the previous books, the wizarding community is no longer divided between good and evil but now in three parts: those who support Lord Voldemort (including his precious Death Eaters), those who support Dumbledore in his fight again Voldemort and believe that Voldemort has returned, and those (like the Minister and Ministry of Magic) who are in denial of his return and believe that Harry and Dumbledore are making up stories in attempts at overthrowing the Ministry.In this book, Harry also finds himself growing older and dealing with problems such as hormones and mood swings (and end-of-the-year standardized tests) but in the end must find loyalty and strength in his friends and family to overcome the great evil that has arisen.",FALSE,2003,1472
"5399",2,731190,FALSE,"870 pages is a heck of a big book.  However after the first 300 pages nothing much has happened and what has happened is rather poorly described.

My 1st edition/1st printing could have easily been one in thirteen million.I was bound to give this four stars as I thought there would be quite a few disappointed fans--just to keep the ratings high.  But skimming through all the reviews, I'm glad I could totally be honest.  Looks to me like reading slow and immersing yourself in the magic beats reading fast no matter how many times you reread. I'm still a fan, though and I'd probably fall in line the very minute the next installment goes on sale (donning my Holyhead Harpies quidditch uniform so I can get some kind of discount).If one looks at the bigger picture and considers all seven books as one extended novel, the outcome of the 5th volume is totally expected.  Everything has to simmer down after the intensity of book 4.  Harry's on his 5th year and about to take his major!  There had to be explanations about OWLS and NEWTS, there had to be in-depth views on the wizarding world, there had to be characters that did nothing more than change their appearance at will, Dumbledore had to give Harry back his innocence and let him know only as much as he already discovered for himself, and Voldemort has to consider being rash and rethink why Harry has foiled his plans four different times already. And of course all that makes for a long, almost-900-page, drawn out book.I'm looking to the bright side.  There was a lot of set-up here for two polished gems.

And, after staying up since midnight to finish it, I can happily say that you probably will be too.  We first meet Harry back on Privet Drive, stuck with the Dursleys and desperate for news of what might be happening in the wizard world. Luckily, he escapes his relatives fairly quickly, but his frustration at being kept in the dark continues as the older wizards who have joined the Order of the Phoenix ( a group determined not to let Voldemort establish another reign of terror) are unwilling to tell Harry & his friends much of what's going on in the struggle because of their age.  Things are no picnic at school either. Harry faces a lot of different challenges in his fifth year at Hogwarts, including OWLs and the increased involvement of the Ministry of Magic in the running of Hogwarts. Since Harry knows Voldemort has returned, he finds it hard to keep quiet when the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher refuses to admit Voldemort's rebirth, and as the Ministry passes increasingly severe ordinances which govern how Hogwarts is run. Also, Harry's ability revealed in book 4 of sometimes being able to see what Voldemort is up to increases, as does Harry's fear that perhaps this power flows both ways, and Voldemort can see what Harry's up to...  I don't want to go into too much more detail, reading the book is infinitely more fun than reading this review, so a few last thoughts:  The Weasley Twins are really in their element throughout this new book; there's a whole lot less Quidditch, which was a pity; Harry steps up and accepts a great deal of responsibility to try and help his friends and fellow students prepare in case of an attack by Voldemort; we get to see a lot more budding romances at Hogwarts which add to all Harry's worries; and an important person in Harry's life does die.I can't wait for book 6 already.",FALSE,2003,1467

One reason may be because I spent so many years waiting so impatiently. However I do think it is my least favorite book of the series. The main reason is the ending, I cried my eyes out when I read the last couple of chapters! I suppose I should one again congradulate Mrs. Rowling for creating such a great character that when he is destroyed, though he is only fictional, he can bring such sadness to the reader. Secondly, the book is way too long. I think the book lost some of its momentum when Mrs. Rowling would spend over a chapter taking you through the Department of Mysteries or the Ministry of Magic. Her other books were much more fast paced and thus more exciting. Overall excellent read. I would recommend it to anyone, but make sure to read the ending with a box of tissues.

It has a good storyline that has different ideas than the other novels do to Harry's different experiences.  The plotting with Harry is based more on his personal dealings with Voldemort than his class work.  When you pick up this book it makes you hang on to it so you can find out the questions that you have throughout the story.  Don't worry.  This one isn't a cliffhanger in the end. Towards the end of the summer Harry gets attacked by dementors with his cousin but fends them off with ease.  Then due to underage wizardry, Harry has a chance of being expelled.  When the Durslseys  are gone, members of The Order of the Phoenix, Lupin and Moody, come and bring him to the headquarters.  He meets up with Ron and Hermonie at Sirius's place and they tell him what the Order is about.  Next thing you know it's back to Hogwarts but this time Ron and Hermonie are prefects.  When they sit down in the great hall they find the woman who was in Harry's trial, is their defense against the dark arts teacher.  Then later on through the year, she becomes the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and she can pass her own rules for the school.  The twins and Harry, due to a new rule, were banned from Quidditch for fighting and Mrs.Umbridge confiscated their brooms.  Mr.Weasly is later bitten by a snake and gets very ill but soon recovers.  Harry's secret defense meetings were snooped out and Dumbledore took the blame for the organization and leaves.  Now, Umbridge goes from High Inquisitor to the Headmistress of Hogwarts so the twins start trouble and don't care any more and soon after, leave the school.  When Harry, Ron, and Hermonie are taking their O.W.L.'s, Harry dozes off and has a vision that Voldemort is torturing Sirius. So, is Sirius ok? Will Dumbledore ever come back? WWHD aka what will Harry do?  Well you can always read the book and find out. Oh I do think a mature, adventurous, fantasy-loving reader would like this book.  Right off the bat, who doesn't like a little magic here and there?  Adventure is a man's best friend, well it's not that friendly considering Harry's struggles.

He and Cho were good at first but the way Rowling made them split up was a way to add to that anger and frustrations.And of course, Harry's visions of the corridor and of the Dark Lord were highly described and added to that dark undergrowth of the story.Overall, action-packed and gripping, and all Potter fans will have to agree, the best Harry Potter ever imaginable.

"5410",3,732275,FALSE,"Picking up where #4 left off, the Ministry of Magic is determined to keep the truth of Voldemort's return a secret and go so far as to brand Harry and Dumbledore liars. Following a brush with a Dementor in Muggle public that put our angst ridden hero on trial, Harry finds himself catching up with godfather Sirius Black at Black's old family home, which is now the headquarters of an anti-Voldemort unit called the Order of the Phoenix, reformed from the first war. Along the way, Harry's frustrations include both minor annoyances like Ron being made prefect instead of him, much to the shock the Weasley family as well as the shock and embarrassment of Hermione, the other new prefect, to bigger ones like trying to handle a real relationship with his crush Cho Chang, who is more or less leaning on him because she has not yet made peace with the death of her boyfriend Cedric Diggory in the previous book, to battling the evil Ministry hench-woman Dolores Umbridge, sent to Hogwarts as a ""high inquisitor"" to annoy the staff and students while trying to get at Dumbledore to an unexpected estrangement from Dumbledore, trying to do Occlumency tests with Snape and learning the truth of the antagonism between his late father James and Snape.Oh yeah, and JK cops out and uses the old ""Harry's a kid of prophecy"" cliche.Tempers flare, bridges are burned, people are killed, and angst runs high in this 5th entry in the series. Unfortunately, the angst factor is cranked up so high in this one that it becomes almost unbearable, more frustrating than enjoyable. While never as bad as the crappy 2nd book (and the crappy 2nd book is unfortunately given unnecessary reference at least twice), it suffers from the same problem as book 4 - too long and lacking in focus, so it's once again like trying to run a marathon from Baltimore to California. There's so much angst embedded in the fiber of this book that your eyes start bleeding, and you keep wondering when the angst will end and when the book will get back to the actual story. I myself kept thinking ""Okay, enough with the angst, get back to the story please."" The only reprieve of any kind is given in the form of Luna Lovegood, aptly described as the anti-Hermione, who, unlike some other characters, is actually quite funny and engaging. The expanded roles of Ginny Weasley and even Neville Longbottom also provide bright spots.Sadly, this book marks a decline in the importance of Ron, who is unfortunately beginning to resemble his film counterpart. Despite being made a prefect and standing up to the students who don't believe in Harry, Ron plays no real significant role in this entry. Although he joins the quidditch team as keeper, he spends so much of the book being too nervous and intimidated that he keeps performing badly, making himself an object of ridicule, until towards the end where he finally gets his act together and helps win the big game. Except perhaps for that one game, Ron does absolutely nothing important, he's merely there to fill up space, and he doesn't develop much either. Hell, Ron gets KOed during the climax, which could have been a great showcase for his under-estimated abilities.Hermione, meanwhile, becomes the epitome of annoying. While she always had a tendency to bug us in the past books, here she is just so damn smug, so full of herself, so hoity toity and holier than thou and I-know-more-than-all-of-you-put-together that you just want to smack her.

I almost needed a tissue myself.  The ending was rather melancholy, but was not without hope.  The author apparently fully appreciates that while there can be forgiveness, the effects of evil cannot be wholly undone, at least not in this world.  I have a strong inkling of where JK Rowling may be headed, and if I am correct, I applaud her boldness and daring.  I have read '...Phoenix', twice and am in the process of rereading the first four.  What took place in Phoenix brought a lot of what happened in one through four into much sharper focus.  To state the obvious, this is not an onging series like CS Lewis' Narnia stories, but is one continuous story like Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'.  Read from that perspective the whole thing makes much more sense than if read as separate installments.  I hope you like the story, it has been told before, but bears retelling.  I believe Harry's anger and anguish, present in so much of number five, were reactions to the unimaginable suffering he has had to endure up to now.  Though he asked Dubledore to relieve him of the task he has been elected to bear, the final conversations he has with Nick and Luna seem to indicate he experienced an epihany of sorts.  He now appears to be willing to take up his burden, having been strengthened and shaped, as though by a potter, by the pain and suffering he has endured.

"5415",5,732232,FALSE,"Back in the office at work, I heard a wench yakking to another colleague spilling out who'd died in the book, as there's a lot of talk about a body count or so, but to my infuriation she went on naming those that are said to have died in the book, that the least I could do is cover my ears and hum - for it's really damaging to be given spoilers prior to your indulging on a particular work; and though some of the names (mainly major characters in the book) have already spilled to enter my ear from her mouth - I only take it then that perhaps these wannabe's (being that they're only being stupid that's why they are such) have just misread what's in the book; and to my relief HAH! I'm right. My, ain't that grand ;-). I'm livin' in the philipaens that's why there are such...However, there is indeed a character (or so) who've died amidst certain turning points in this book, along with a situation that sentenced Harry in being expelled from Hogwarts, wherein Potter's reputation is tarnished more than ever before - and it doesn't help when The Daily Prophet contributes to that stating that he's nothing but a conceited attention-getter; and above all these, his best buddy Ron's brother Percy believe it so, along with the majority of the people in Hogwarts.To add spice into it, enter the school's new administration in-charge Dolores Umbridge, who is one among the new characters presented in the book. I found a number of situations' relevance to Potter that are akin to mine going through some phase in the same age of rebellious streak when I was fifteen.There are also some major changes along the storyline, including something which involve Harry's closest circle of friends - Hermoine and Ron. And in this one, there is something about Dumbledore that is rather best read than described, which is nothing that we've ever seen (or read rather (heard for those on the audio books)) about the Wizard before. Also, there is a revelation encountered by Potter regarding his father, and it would totally change his perspective in the way he views his dad from this point on.Plus, there's a lot of great deal of Kharma that it seemed to indicate here for what is being dealth around on Potter regarding what he is being subjected to right now in this point of his life.J.K. Rowling had done a splendid job not only in this particular installment, but in the entire series in general - wherein Rowling had the ingenuity of spinning tales amidst the storylines which subject its readers to find it hard in putting down the book, although its not an unfamiliar thing that she uses certain elements (mainly like the names within certain places and characters) that are either obviously taken blatantly or subtly from works of other authors such as within the likes of Roald Dahl, Fantasy flicks (like LABYRINTH) or C. S. Lewis - Rowling had the ability to turn great spins within the storylines and its characters, which are nothing short of being magical.An example to this would be The Ministry of Magic, which is in the vein of The ministry of Truth of sorts (although not exactly) from George Orwell's non-sci-fi (sic) fiction called 1984, (wherein the civilization have been taken over by a very dominant ruling party that's as sinister as any dictatorial government could ever be, and monotonously instating certain departments completely to certain sectors of the government like the said Ministry wherein all media operations are handled over in that fiction by Orwell).If one would study the Occult, it could be found that Rowling had certain referential bits of hidden-anecdotes regarding occultism, such as the term `ehwaz' for which Hermoine complained about having misinterpreted the term for `eiwaz' which means `defense' rather than `partnership' on their studies, that made her lost a point in their exams - which is actually similar to the sound of famed british occultist Alister Crowley's own allegedly declared higher being/guardian angel - the entity, AIWAS.What's peculiar, looking at it if one would consider, Rowling've seemed to have taken a well handled scope as far as executing the aspect regarding the way she depicted the Magick arts, although far be it if ever the skills of Hogwarts' wizards and students could manifest in reality similar to these characters as depicted for those who are involved in the occult - but it is apparently good of Rowling to depict Magick balanced with actual occult concepts - if one would observe, Voldermont being of the Dark side is strong and aggressive, whilst his arch nemesis counterpart Albus Dumbledore being of the good side - that although strong, only used defensive counter-attacks on Voldermont, which is inherently characteristic of `White Magic'. I love this work of fiction by Rowling. Much of these are seen in the explosive action packed climax in the book, particularly on chapter 35, which I can't hardly continue to read at the time due to great excitement.Also there's great action sequence with Potter's part of duel against the sadistic Belatrix Lastrange, notorious for having slain several wizards in the history of Hogwarts, and from using the Cruciatus curse on Nevile Longbottom's parents that got `em totally insane.Man, I can't wait for the movie adaptation.And amidst all of the rubble that we'd find Harry Potter subjected into in this 5th part of the series - of course there's also the matter about his love interest for Cho Chang. Much likely on the upcoming movie adaptation for this here, the book 5 of the series - there'd be a lot of screaming and temper tantrums required for Daniel Radcliff in playing the part for his portrayal of Harry Potter this time around, and a lot of crying for the girl who portrays Cho Chang - Katie Leung, who's not that bad really, but it's only that she looked like more of an Hawiian girl than an oriental.As for Potter's feel of affection for Chang -- There are times when I wish if only I could shout at Harry on the book and tell him, ""Bah! Forget about that Cho chick! She's bad news. Why don't you go for Hermoine instead?!"" But I found to take it as something personal though regarding Hermoine's comments about `four legs'.However, for me - Book 5 ranks as one of the best in the series. Rumour has it that:In this 5th installment - there's something in it that J.K. Rowling seemed to've laced it hexed with a curse that says: ""Do it today or later you'll pay!"" within every turn per chapter. In toto - The book wrapped itself so neatly at the finish.Some quotes:""Wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure."" ~ Luna Lovegood (p186)Peeves the Poltergeist: ""Oh most think he's barking,the Potty wee lad,But some are more kindly and think he's just sad,But Peevesy knows better and says that he's mad ---""Harry Crackpot: SHUT UP!(p. 247)""Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked easily - weak people in other words -- ... Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!""~ Severus Snape (p. 536)Overall...okay I cant help it, I guess its excusable enough that I'd do at least a one single Spiller here, alright.

"5419",5,731576,FALSE,"I have to laugh at myself for writing this review.  5,251 reviews and counting!  I can't imagine that more than a handful of people will ever read it.  However, after reading some of the other reviews, I just had to throw in my two cents about this book.  I brought this book home from the bookstore on a Friday evening and had finished it by Sunday morning.  I literally could not put it down!  I also - literally - had tears running down my cheeks as I read the last pages.  I am a 38 year old computer programmer who is not normally given to emotional outbursts like this, and I also don't normally read fiction.  However, I just happened to pick up the book in the bookstore and begin flipping through the pages out of curiosity.  30 minutes later, I couldn't put it down, so I had to buy it and bring it home.  The book really grabs your interest and holds it!I have read comments by other reviewers to the effect that the Harry Potter books are not terribly original in their plots, characters, settings, etc., and I have to agree - that is true.  However, the books are EXTREMELY well written.  If you want to become a novelist, you should study these books just for the writing techniques they use.  Almost nothing happens that is not foreshadowed in some small way hundreds of pages earlier in the book, and the foreshadowing is subtle and seamless.  The overall effect is that, even though there ARE surprises, everything makes sense.  (Many things are even foreshadowed in the previous books.)  It gives all of the fantastic events a feel of ""reasonableness"".  There is nothing in the book that does not have a reason for being there.  All of the events fit together perfectly, like the pieces of a puzzle.The use of language is superb.  The descriptions of people, things, situations, etc. are very engaging.  It is hard to use the word REALISTIC about a fantasy setting, but the descriptions really draw you into the story.  You feel that you are THERE - almost as if you were living the story.  You can truly feel the emotions of the characters within your own heart.  You can feel Harry's powerful, heart-rending sorrow and remorse at the end of the book as if it were your own.  At other points in the book, you can feel the fear, suspense, anger, joy, laughter, etc. that you would feel if the events of the story were truly happening to you.However, it is the characters, in my opinion that are the most engaging aspect of the book.  They are so, so well done that you can immediately relate to them.  The setting may be fantastic, but the characters are very, very real.  More than that, you come to truly care about the characters.  What happens to them matters to you.  I don't want to give away the ending for the five or six people in the English-speaking world who haven't read it yet, but when someone dies in the book, you feel the loss personally.  It is as if someone you knew and liked - someone close to you - had died.This was the first book in the Harry Potter series I had ever read.  I hadn't even seen any of the movies.  After I finished this one, I just had to have more.  So, I bought the other four books and read them through (in reverse order, actually).  In my opinion, the fifth book is the best of the series so far, and I can't wait for number six to come out.  I liked all of the other books, but I thought one and two were a bit childish and the boy-hero (at age 11 and 12) just a bit too unlikely for me, but perhaps that is what appeals so strongly to children.  If, however, you haven't read any of the other books in the series, don't feel that you have to slog through the other four before diving into this one.  The writer (or more likely, her editors) gives you just enough information about prior events to be getting on with the current story without bogging down the narrative.  (It also doesn't give away so much that the other books are spoiled for you.  I found the other books, particularly number four, quite engaging, even though I read them in the wrong order.)I feel that some of the other reviewers are overly fussy in their criticisms of the main character and the feelings he displays in this book.  (Perhaps they are mothers with young children.)  Two of the main themes of this book - death and the turbulent emotions of adolescent men - are more mature than those of the previous books.  Book four did deal with death, but it was a ""clean"" death in that the main character could not reasonably feel any responsibility for it.  Death, in this book, is ""messy"" in that there is plenty of guilt to stir in with the sorrow and remorse.  As for those turbulent emotions, I certainly remember what it was like to be 15.  Don't you?  (For those readers younger than 15, don't worry.  You'll understand what I mean when you get there.)",FALSE,2004,1855

Ron and Hermione (not to mention Ginny and Neville) developed more fleshed-out personalities, we got to understand Snape better, we found out Dumbledore is human, and, not least, we got an idea that Harry may be tempted to join the ""dark side"" so to speak in the next book. For all those who think Harry was too bitter in this book, imagine the burden that he is carrying from book four, where he saw a boy close to his own age die. Remember that the boy who died also happened to be Cho's boyfriend, and then imagine all the attendant guilt. Remember too that Harry is the only one to have faced Voldemort face to face so many times and the only one to have seen him come back; and yet he's out of the loop; even his friends and mentors won't tell him all that's going on.

He has human reactions and the tension of his inner conflict made for a great book five, and I'm sure will make for an even better book six.",FALSE,2004,1812
"5424",5,731191,FALSE,"This new chapter in the Harry Potter collection will not disappoint you. At 870 pages it is still a quick read and seems shorter than it really is. While it may not have as many action scenes as Goblet of Fire, it has more in the department of character development.This book seemed to be much more about friendship and how important it is to stand united. In this new story we see just about all the characters from the previous stories. We see much more of Fred and George Weasley, Nevielle Longbottom, Sirius Black, as well as some brand new characters. I grew rather attached to these characters and it struck me harder than I thought it would when one of the characters died.The dialogue is excellent of course and is often funny. This book had more humorous lines than any of the others and in my opinion had the best dialogue. The action scenes in this book were albeit, very well done, yet not as intense as in Goblet of Fire. To get to the action scenes of the book you'll have to wait until the end. And, more importantly, you will wait until the end to find the answer to the question that began in the first story, why does Voldemort want to kill Harry.This story was really well done, but I did not enjoy it as much as the previous installment, The Goblet of Fire. But, do not let that stop you from reading this book. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you will enjoy it.

After picking up the book on Saturday morning, I ploughed through it (not as fast as my little brother, who read it all in one day) and just finished feeling more entranced with the world of Harry Potter than I had thought possible.In this, the 5th book in a promised 7-book series, Harry returns to Hogwarts for his 5th year.  Now 15 years old, Harry and his friends face many challenges: academic challenges, both familiar (Snape's ever-painful Potions class) and new (O.W.L. tests); social challenges (Quidditch cup is at stake again; Who will be chosen as prefects?); and personal challenges (fluxuating hormones, the strains of OWLS on friendship). Oh yes, and then there's that little problem of Lord Voldemort being back and gaining power.I don't want to spoil it for anyone...so I'll just say this: The 5th Harry Potter book is an amazing adventure in terms of both action and character-development. With Harry, we meet new teachers and new friends; learn more about the Dursley family and more about the Ministry of Magic; explore new branches of magic and new rooms in the castle; visit the forest and get butterbeer in Hogsmede; learn more about Harry's parents and all about the Order; see corruption abound and cheer those brave enough to fight it...from the Forbidden forest to a first kiss...from giants to centaurs...from long dark hallways to secrets too-long-held...from start to end, this book is amazing.",FALSE,2003,1468

J.K.Rowling takes the reader deeper into the world of Wizardry showing tales of it to be as relevant, complex, challenging and disturbing as tales of the human world.This is a book of dark discovery. Harry discovers more about himself, his destiny and his ancestry as the light-hearted shades of boyhood take on the darker hues of teen-angst. We learn more of Sirus, Hagrid and Snape as the story unfolds and Harry has to learn to come to terms with some unpalatable truths as well as some marvellous new creatures and magical devices.The author not only shows a talent for delving into the mystical world of her own creation but also demonstrates good insight into the workings of the adolescent mind. The confusing surges of emotion and self absorption that characterizes the mid-teens, the attraction to members of the opposite sex (and confusion as to how their minds work!), stress of examinations, being faced with decisions that you do not feel equipped to take and the guilt of taking a course of action that has dire consequence are portrayed simply, but beautifully. The initial readership will have grown up with the character and this development will not be lost on them (or their parents!). They will enjoy, as I have done, the way that characters, creatures and contraptions from the first four books are woven into the telling, revealing perhaps another facet of them as it does so, enriching the re-reading of their first appearance in the imagination.For `first timers', however, this book stands up as a thrilling (and from time to time very deep and/or dark) tale of basic questions and truths about good and evil wrapped up in a delightfully entertaining wrapper of a world with mystical and mythical characteristics.

Most of the people I've talked with who recently read the subsequent SIXTH book in this series told me they had almost no recollection of what had happened in this book, the fifth book, and my experience was similar.  Things happen, but the plot(?) feels unstructured and bloated, and the tight focus and drive of the fourth book feels completely absent here.  Long passages of this book take place holed up in a scret headquarters, and feel long and longwinded; they made me want to shout, ""Something happen, please!""Rumors circulated when this came out that this was actually written by a team of ghostwriters, and whether or not that's true, the book kind of feels like it was--like a book written by a committee that couldn't decide what to cut out and so didn't cut out anything.As a part of the overall saga of Harry Potter, you'll need to read this book; it's a fast read and you won't hate reading it.

For someone who loves to read, the extra long length of Order of the Phoenix isn't an obstacle at all. The dark turn of the series is reminiscent of C. S.

I burned through all four previous installments, though I must admit I wasn't very sure what was so 'magical' about the series. I thought the first one to be sugary rubbish, the second to be more of the same. The third, with it's darker themes, began to intrigue me somewhat, though I still did not care much more for the characters or the story. The fourth was the first in the series I found to be truly worth reading, and I was certainly not very dissapointed by The Order of the Phoenix.Taking place is young Potter's 5th year at Hogwarts, Harry has gone from hotshot to laughingstock, thanks to a prominent newspaper discounting his latest near death experience and making fun of him all summer. After several troubles displaying the turmoil of the magical world, Harry ends up back at Hogwarts, yet the school of his memories has changed nearly as rapidly as he himself has, and the world around him has also.Order of the Phoenix is, in almost all respects, a dark book, with dark themes. The once modest Harry has begun to believe the other-wordly hype that had been previously sorrounding him, and has begun to gain quite an Anakin Skywalker complex as his rage and temper continually flare. His friends and protectors, likewise, have also begun to flare, as the prospect of war looms ever closer, soon to engulf both Hogwarts and the entire world, magical and not.Themes of death, murder, betrayal, anger, confusion, fear, rebellion and arrogance weave throughout the lengthy novel, and when finished, there is no light hearted return to Pivet drive, instead, there are dark clouds on the horizon, for it is clear the worst has yet to come.Quite enjoyable. Hope it gets darker!",FALSE,2003,1470
"5436",5,731930,FALSE,"Having just read the Half-Blood Prince, Order of the Phoenix clearly stands out as the best in the series so far.  Everything the new book has been praised for--background, character development, suspense--is just as strong if not stronger in Book 5. OOTP's 800+ pages fit in all kinds of events and memorable scenes while the ""leaner"" HBP glides along without anything happening for hundreds of pages.  Not only is Harry portrayed realistically (sometimes annoyingly so) as a moody teenager, but the rest of the characters also play important roles and great new characters like Luna Lovegood and Tonks appear as well.  I am astounded that people can call this book boring while heaping praise on Book 6--this one starts off with a bang (well, a CRACK) and maintains a constant sense of urgency through to the end.  The atmosphere is surprisingly much darker in this book than in any other due to the situation at Hogwarts, Harry's pariah status, and Dumbledore's absence.  The suspense builds steadily as the Ministry's control over Hogwarts spreads until all hell breaks loose and the long, heart-stopping climax occurs.  This book is heavy on plot but does not skimp on anything else either.  All the characters shine in their respective scenes (Hermione is absolutely brilliant, and Neville and Ginny are impressive too).  Unlike the Goblet of Fire, the premise of OOTP is much more reasonable and does not require a long-winded confession from the unmasked villain at the end.  And Book 5 is simply much more ambitious than the first 3 books, making it a greater entry in the series.  I only hope Book 7 can live up to the standards set in this book and those before it.",FALSE,2005,2209

It took me until Thursday to finish it, mainly because I HAD to work during the day. I'm 48 years old and I never thought a ""children's"" book would hold me so enthralled, but it did, from the moment I cracked the thing open. Harry is more, well, human, in this book, as Rowling begins to deal with his adolescence and puberty. It makes the book ring true. Life is not always just black and white, so she brings this out in Harry's struggles to be himself. We find that, in fact, he is a reluctant hero, trying to find out for himself what life means. It is masterfully told. I'm also glad that Ms. Rowling introduces characters of color in this one, not that it greatly matters, but, being black myself, I am grateful to see that Harry's world is diverse, too. Let's hope Cho comes to her senses. Anyway, I can hardly wait for the next book. Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for making this one so wonderful.",FALSE,2003,1475

"5442",4,731211,FALSE,"I was debating between three and four stars, but gave credit because I finished it in one day, so at least I wasn't bored.I tend to like that the latest books are getting darker and more involved, but I'm beginning to get frustrated with the lack of development when it comes to characters. Sirius especially seems underdevoloped, and I loved him best. And it seemed completely useless for Harry to use the fire to talk to Sirius about what he saw in the penseive. I mean, he's supposed to be getting more mature, and yet he risked getting caught just to talk about something that happened well over sixteen years ago. Plus his constant yelling and complaining was beginning to get on my nerves.My biggest problem with this book was the chapter ""Beyond the Veil"" and I don't want to spoil anything for those who hadn't read it, but that threw me into a fit. What 'the veil' is was never explained, but to her credit, at least this time I cared what happened, despite the fact that it was the worst thing that happened in the entire book!It seemed to drone, and Harry, as usual, was ignorant and naive to the end, and has gotten far too much of an attitude problem. It's kind of frustrating that the one character I did care about will most likely not show up again. Unless J.K. brings him back, I think I'm done with the series.To its credit, the book was decently written, obviously oriented towards a younger audience, which explains her lack of detail when it came to Harry and Cho, which was incredibly frustrating, and I wasn't sure whether I should laugh at him or pound my head against the wall for his ignorance.

"5443",5,731191,FALSE,"""The Order of the Phoenix"" starts off by reminding us that Harry Potter is no longer the cute little kid who is happily discovering the wizarding world.  By the time we get vary far, we see that Harry is indeed 15 and is very angry about ... well, just about everything.  He barely escapes attack just outside of Number 4, Privet Drive, and despite his heroics (and his past heroics), he finds that the grown-ups don't want to tell him what's that's going on.  Not only that, but his and Dumbledore's revelation at the end of The Goblet of Fire that He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named is back will have dire consequences for his fifth year at Hogwarts, and for his professors as well.  And, of course, there's always Lord V himself, and his (somewhat) faithful Death-Eaters, as if life wasn't hard enough ...The Order of the Phoenix changes the tone of the Potter series; it becomes darker almost right from the first pages, and an oppressive tone runs through the entire novel.  This makes absolute sense in that the wizarding world stands on the edge of a second civil war, and as we know from the end of Goblet of Fire, its government is in serious denial.  Phoenix is more complicated, less straightforward, and involves more psychological pain than any of the preceding installments.  It treats the characters (and the readers) more like adults than ever.I found this book absolutely engrossing.  Like many fans of the series, I was hardly able to put the book down to get a decent night's sleep.  It's been worth the wait to see Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Dumbledore back in action (and there's a lot of that).

"5444",5,731525,FALSE,"When I first recieved this book in the first hours of June 21 (it was a midnight bookstore party, that's how obsessed I am), I was fearful that somehow the gargantuan text wouldn't live up to the literary legends its predecessors set. After the first three pages I was no longer worried. Rowling proves her vivid imagination and sense of humor is still in excellent condition (there are many more jokes in this book than the rest by far) and retains an excellent memory of the emotional traumas and doubts that come during the teenage years. Being fifteen myself when I read the book, I can say with all the confidence in the world, that Harry's outbursts of anger are not excessive, melodramatic, nor unrealistic. With the incompetence of authorities at Hogwarts, the corruption of government, ridicule and slander aimed at him by the Daily Prophet, betrayal of several respected acquaintances, Dumbledore's mysterious apthay to comfort Harry, disappointing changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and a preventable death at the end, I can't say I wouldn't act the same. Ms. Rowling is perfectly reasonable to add grief and gloom to the fifth book; this is a time Harry discovers the shades of gray between people and learns lessons on socializing with girls, rather than knocking out trolls and slaying basilisks. Dumbledore can make fatal mistakes; his father was far from the perfect role model Harry thought him to be; and Snape is not the wholly evil character Harry thought he was in the first book, but a more multi-dimensional human being, worthy of pity. Book Five is an ingenious balance between humor and tragedy, physical, mental, and social challenges, unhelpful role models and pity-arousing villians, life-ruining woes and uplifting loyalty. Characters are much more well-rounded and believable than before (Ron-and-Hermione-esque squabbles are well-known to any pair of teenage friends), and show increasing maturity as students rebel against impotent teachers (namely, the evil toad of a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher) and develop leadership skills and independence when they take disatisfactory classes into their own hands. The fifth book is without doubt my favorite in the series, as Ms. Rowling proves to us it's not the suspensful battles and mysteries that make up the heart and soul of the Harry Potter books, but the throughly developed characters and worldly themes that grow more complicated and diverse for each book.

There were more problems and Harry had some feelings that were much different from the other books. Harry is in his fifth year of Hogwarts and fifteen years old, that period when you are nearly an adult and problems are bigger.I would give this book a five star rating. It was long but very interesting. Harry was in trouble often, and he had to deal with these problems differently than in past books. I was curious with how he would deal with these problems. They were problems that just about anyone could have. It was more like real life as he had people that didn't like him.Harry is under more pressure and seems to be uncertain about what action he should do. Because of all the uncertainty, Harry is more moody and even negative. Like real people, he doesn't necessarily deal with pressure well. In the other books, it felt like Harry had more control over the situation. Harry, like in the other books, does try to find a way to solve the problem and get things done.The first interesting scene is when Harry is out at the park alone late at night. He saw Dudley, his cousin, and met him when his friends left. Harry was teasing him about how Petunia, Harry's aunt, calls him Dudders and of these little boy names. As this was going on, two Dementors appeared in the alley way. They attacked Harry and Dudley. Harrygot out his wand, and used the patronus charm. He was already warned for misuse of majic, but Harry considered it a life-threatening situation. Dudley told on him and he had to appear in court.I also found the scene in the court room interesting. Cornelius Fudge, one of judges for the Ministry of Magic, hates Harry and wants the pleasure of sending Harry to prison. Dumbledore came to save the day for Harry. He helped convince the court that Harry is innocent and got him cleared of all charges. As a result, many people doubted if Harry was really as good a person as they were led to believe. This adversity kept me reading. I wanted to see how he would recover from this setback and regain his popularity.It was a much different book compared to the first four, but I enjoyed it the most.

And considering the fact that he recorded over a entire day's worth of narration, it's a wonder he didn't make loads of mistakes.  Most importantly, there is no such thing as a small character to Jim Dale -- every voice is unique and holds their own among the other voices.

However, I can't seem to say the same about the Harry Potter movies. I was greatly disappointed when leaving the Movie Theater after watching The Chamber of Secrets. Nor was I enthused to see the new trailer for the third book called The Prisoner of Azkaban releasing in theaters this June. This is why it is up to me to convince you to read the book before watching the movie or else, you might never get around reading it.

Despite all the popularity and mass production of Harry Potter merchandises, I consider myself loyal to its original publication. I do not usually read books from sell- out authors but J.K Rowling is an exception to my rule. That of course is my personal opinion and it should not matter or keep you away from reading it. The fact is that The Harry Potter series are great hook-on books that'll keep you to the edge of your seat until the end.If you are worried about getting lost because you haven't read the two books that came before The Prisoner of Azkaban than, don't be.  Because the only thing you should be concerned about is getting back to your mundane life after reading one paragraph of the supernatural world of Harry Potter.

Also, if Sirius Black didn't kill Harry's Parents then who did and is he Voldermort's slave? [Preferably known as he who should not be named.]We are also introduced to the creatures called Dementors and a Hippogriff named Buckbeak. Harry is afraid of the Dementors and their effect on him because his past was so horrible. It gets to a point where one of the Dementors prepares to suck the soul out of Harry, whose patronus charm is simply not strong enough and then.... Well, I'll guess you'll have to read it and find out for yourself. Meanwhile, Buckbeak is to be executed for attacking Malfoy. However, Harry gets the chance to turn it all around but can he save Buckbeak and Sirius just in time to get back to the present time?The reader is given the hope that Harry will no longer have to live with his awful aunt, uncle and his obese cousin known as the Dursleys.

In one unfortunate day, two dementors came at night who were dark, feared guards of the wizard prison at Azkaban. The dementors were trying to remove the soul from Dudley, but Harry made them flee by casting patronus charms with his wand. Uncle Vernon grew furious when Dudley grew sick. Harry was also horrified because he received a letter of expulsion for using magic in the muggle world. Later, the Dursleys were tricked to leave for a lawn contest at night. After this trick, the advance guard came to rescue Harry to send him to Sirius's home on broomsticks. The advance guard consisted of friends and former teachers with Tonks, Sirius, Lupin, Mad-eye Moody, and Kingsley Shacklebot. When Harry arrived At Sirius's home, he was furious to discover that his best friends Ron and Hermoine had been at Sirius's home for the whole time. 13 people also ate together which meant that the first person to stand is the first person to die. Harry then discovers the ministry of magic, which is a large, underground workplace. Harry also had to go to the wizard court to decide about his expulsion, and Harry becomes free of all charges. Harry also becomes jealous because Ron and Hermoine become chosen as prefects that are special school leaders.Harry arrives at Hogwarts by train with the other students. Harry becomes upset to find that a great, large gamekeeper named Hagrid did not arrive. Harry also meets his new defense against the dark arts teacher, Professor Umbridge, who made Harry write with a quill that caused his hand to bleed as he wrote when he served detention. Sirius also had to hide in the mountains because dementors were after him because he was known as a criminal. Then Umbridge gains authority as the Hogwarts high Inquisitor. Ron and Hermoine also set up an illegal club where students learn how to fight with spells, which was designed to fight Voldemort and his workers. Harry's trusty owl, Hedwig and Sirius, were attacked by Umbridge. Later in a sport played on broomsticks called Qidditch, Ron replaced the new goalkeeper and Harry was banned from the sport for fighting his rival, Draco Malfoy. Hagrid had also returned injured by giants because he was on a mission sent by dumbledore. Harry and his Illegal club then are caught by Umbridge. Then Fred and George, Ron's brothers escape from Hogwarts by taking the brooms that Umbridge had confiscated. Harry also begins to see lord Voldemort's perspective of how he is feeling. Harry also faces the O.W.L.s that were ordinary wizardring levels that were a set of tests Harry had to take in his fifth year. Harry then uses the fire in professor Umbridge's fire to try to communicate with Sirius, but Harry is caught. Hermoine then leads Umbridge to a group of centaurs in the forbidden forest who trample her and fire arrows at Hagrid's half brother, Grawp. After this, Harry decided to go to the department because he knew that Voldemort was torturing Sirius. Harry flew on special horses with some more other students that were invisible to the people who have not seen death. As Harry goes through a set of doors, there is a fight with death eaters that were people who work for Voldemort. Then the advance guards come and duel with death eaters. Then Sirius falls into a deep Veil tank and dies. Harry then breaks the prophecy, which was a prediction as a crystal ball. Dumbledore then duels Voldemort face to face and Voldemort flee. Later, Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Voldemort is after him because professor Trewalney, a divination teacher predicted that either Voldemorrt will kill Harry or Harry will kill Voldemort. In the end, the remaining of the advance guard said that if Harry does not write to them in every three days, then they would go to the Dursleys.",FALSE,2004,1802
"5466",5,731186,FALSE,"It has been a very long time since I finished reading a book and immediately wanted to go back and start it over again, but that's the way I felt at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  (Instead, I went back to re-read books 1-4, thereby forcing myself to wait two weeks - I started my second reading yesterday.)  This installment of the series moves things forward, answers many questions, confirms the answers to others - there absolutely will be a final death match between Harry and Voldemort - and raises yet more questions.Character development and shading plays a big part in this book, and there has been much comment about Harry in particular in this light.  As a mother whose own son was fifteen not too long ago, Harry's raging adolescence (and he's certainly raging) rang perfectly true to me.  I think J.K. Rowling took a big risk here, in that this rendering of Harry makes him pretty hard to like at times.  I respect and applaud her for taking that risk, because I think it ultimately serves the character and story well, and by the end of the book, Harry is growing.I think that the ""good"" characters have more dimension and complexity than the ""bad"" ones, but I've felt that way all through the series, so that's no real change.  There are shifts in the dynamics between Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron steps out from Harry's shadow.  A few characters who have been around all the way along move to the foreground, most notably Neville, and we meet some new characters both in and out of Hogwarts.  There's really only one character that has seemed ambiguous throughout, and although we do learn a few more things about Snape, I think there are still questions there.  As far as the ""bad"" characters are concerned, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, is a classic flat-out villain that really needs to be unshaded in order to serve the story.This book has more magic than its predecessors, but even as some of the characters are becoming more identifiably human, so are some of the threats and dangers.  The tone is darker than ever.  The plot itself isn't as riveting as ""Goblet of Fire"" or ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" but there's no shortage of action.I tried to read this one slowly, and I couldn't.  I was never bored, and the length of the book just meant I could spend more time in this world.  I have quibbles with the writing style, but they're not new to this installment; yelling has been shown in all caps in the other books as well, and the dialogue could be left to stand on its own without necessarily describing the manner of speaking (all those speech adverbs!).  These are minor issues to me and don't interfere with my enjoyment of the book at all.The series is continuing to move into new territory, maturing along with its principal character.  Parents of younger Harry fans will need to decide whether their children are up to it and might prefer to read it with them.  If you've been along for the ride since ""Sorcerer's Stone"" - and your expectations are not overly inflated - ""Order of the Phoenix"" is totally worth your time.  I think it will hold up well on its own merits, but it's also important as a transition into the next two books and the climax to this seven-part tale.  I eagerly await Book 6.  I both anticipate and dread Book 7, because I'll hate to see this end.",FALSE,2003,1465

I have grown attached to the characters so much that I would like to know what happens to them every single day within the book, but for time and the sake of the plot I didn't have the luxury.

I really wish she would hurry as fast as she can without rushing.Anyyyway, I suggest this book to anyone although believe it or not it is a bit more mature than the first as it should be. After all Harry Potter was 11 in the first book and now he is 15.

However, that was just the beginning. Not long after he is taken to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, many strange things happen there, it is the meeting place of the Guard, and Order. It is a private place, not located on any map or atlas. There Harry learns only a small fraction of what he needs to be prepared for. Harry faces a hearing due to the many uses of magic during his summer. He finally makes it to Hogwart only to find everyone turning their back to him due to his information about 'he who must not be names'. Everyone is whispering and he has a rather hard time with the best of his friends. Ron and Hermione are prefects, along with Malfoy, and Harry is prett much alone. He starts having dreams and visions of Lord Voldemorts return, having already happened. He dreams of long dark hall ways with many doors and having a glowing door at the end be he can never reach it.

J.K. Rowling shows her outstanding mastery once again through out this subtle yet compelling episode of the Harry Potter Saga. Compared to the first two, this book seems to have a more grown up Harry, coupled with more terrifying adventures and more in depth characters. With Harry growing up and realizing things about his past, he becomes less of a character and more of a real person.

"5471",3,731192,FALSE,"My biggest problem with Book Five of the Harry Potter series can be summed up in the title of this review.The characters are behaving so strangely. Now, grant it, Harry's now a 15 yr old teenager.  Teenagers are full of angst and mood swings.But do you honestly want to read about this for 900 pages?  I don't.I can understand much of Harry's anger.  I'd be irritable too if I had to go home every single summer to be abused, locked in my room and starved.Can anyone tell me why the Hogwarts Wizards don't, until this book (book FIVE) do anything to ease Harry's plight?  In this book, finally, they confront the evil Dursley's and warn them to be nice to Harry.Why didn't they do this, oh, I don't know, back in book ONE maybe?Secondly, the main conflict of this book could have been avoided if Dumbledore had only had one simple conversation with harry.  A single sentence. Anything.  Instead, in a plot device that no other writer could get away with, Dumbledore ignores Harry for most of the book, and never has that conversation.  Thus, this big conflict, big death, etc.It's kind of lame.  Writers are told never to base your conflict on a simple misunderstanding, on something that could be cleared up with one convo. Yet Rowling does exactly this.There are about 300 words too many in this book.  It gets awfully slow in some parts, as if JK Rowling feels that anything and everything her characters do is utterly fascinating.  I LOVE this series but this book was not one of the best.It meandered, it whined, it stomped its page heavy feet like the petulant teen that harry was throughout.Hermione was not drawn very dynmically, and is becoming a charicature of herself.  Dumbledore didn't act like Dumbledore, and neither did Harry.Hagrid annoyed me too, and I'm growing tired of his requests for the ridiculous.  What he asked of Harry and Hermione was so silly.  Even I had to agree that Hagrid may be a tad off his rocker.And mostly, i found the entire ""prophecy thing"" to be one big ""So?""  I already had deduced that much...and i felt like I was sort of ripped off...where's the payout for staying with this book for 900 pages?

Harry is a nice but troublmaking teenager, as is his friend Ron.  Early in the summer Harry was taken from the Dursley's to a secret place.  He starts feeling random emotions and thinks that they might have to do with the evil Lord Voldemorts feelings.  The feelings continue through out the school year and if they weren't hard enough to deal with the Defence Against the dark Arts teacher hates him and he has to take an extra class with his least favorite professor.

"5475",5,731191,FALSE,"With the fifth installment in the Harry Potter series, it seems J. K. Rowling has done something few authors can--she has written a series where the books get better and better. In The Order of the Phoenix, Rowling again proves that she can write good literature, and make it both entertaining and with a good plot.In this book, our hero, Harry Potter, enters his fifth year at Hogwarts. Of course, that's not where the trouble begins. He uses magic during the summer to defend himself and his cousin, Dudley, from being attacked by dementors (you remember those, don't you?) and is so forced to attend a hearing on whether he should be expelled from Hogwarts (since it is against the rules for a young wizard to use magic outside of school, and Harry had already been warned). Not to mention the fact the entire Ministry of Magic has gone bonkers, refusing to believe Harry and Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, that the evil Lord Voldemort has returned. Instead, the Ministry of Magic believes Dumbledore wants to take them over, and so make every attempt to discredit everything Harry and Dumbledore do--including publishing newspaper articles saying Harry is a troubled, attention-seeking boy. Besides those problems, with the Lord Voldemort being back, Harry is contantly plagued by pain in his scar, as well as terrifying dreams that lead him into Voldemort's mind. And, not only that, Harry is also growing up, and dealing with the usual teenage crises. Not only does he have to deal with a particularly nasty Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (who devises a cruel punishment for those who speak out in her class), but he also has to deal with his classmates looking at him oddly, the mixed-up feelings between him and Cho Chang, the constant arguments between his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, *and* he has his O.W.L.S. at the end of the years (basically the Hogwarts equivalent of standardized testing and the SAT). The one thing he truly enjoyed, Quidditch, is taken from him by none other the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher/High Inquisitor. With all this on his mind, Harry has hardly anytime to relax, or even enjoy himself. What little time he does have is spent figuring out what is going on--because neither he, nor the reader, really knows what Voldemort is up to.In the newest book, Rowling makes any teen feel selfish for complaining about their lives, and also makes everyone feel sympathy for Harry's plight. Like Harry, we are left in the dark for most of the book. Like Harry, we wonder, what is the weapon Voldemort wants? Why can Harry enter Voldemort's mind (and vice versa)? Why exactly was he sent to live with the Dursley's after his parents died? And just what are Cho Chang's exact feelings for him? Though Harry is at times cranky and and downright unlikable, it shows Rowling's skills as a writer. She knows Harry is growing up, and he can't always be Superboy--he is a teenager, and is not immune to the normal teenage drama. However, Harry is still an extraordinary boy, and triumphs, as always, though not without a significant loss.The book moves well--with all the Harry Potter books, they're fairly simple to read but not in a dumb kind of way. The plot moves fast, and though the book is a few inches thick, it is not filled with frivolous detail. Rowling gets to her points (and there are a few) and though she leaves the reader in the dark, it helps us to identify with Harry, and makes us all the more eager to finish. Rowling has written a truly terrific book, and the ending leaves the reader satisfied, as she answers a few questions we all had hidden in the back of our minds,Congratulations to J.K. Rowling, and hope we do not have to wait two more years for the next installment, though this one was worth the wait.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5476",3,731189,FALSE,"What can you say about a book this highly anticipated?  It's bound to be at least a little bit of a let-down.  And a let-down it is.  Rowling does a nice job of spinning a yarn that's quite exciting at times, and no one will regret having read the book -- but it doesn't have the tight writing or the sense of wonder the second and third books had.  The magic, if you will, is missing.What's wrong?  To begin with, the thing runs 870 pages and could profitably have been trimmed by at least a third.  It takes 200 pages just to get to Hogwarts, and there's a lot of repetition along the way.  (Did we need to see the clumsy girl wizard knock over a chair 10 times?  Wouldn't 5 have been enough?  For that matter, why was that character even in the book?  She doesn't do anything.  Cut her out entirely and no one would ever notice the absence.)  It feels as though Rowling is too big a star these days for any editor to dare to touch her prose, and that's a shame -- a good editor could have made the book a lot stronger.Then there's the tone.  Yes, it's good that Harry's entering adolescence, and it's good that she treats it realistically -- but how much fun is it to see Harry being peevish, annoyed, grouchy, hurt, and resentful all the time?  I'm not saying this isn't true to the character, just that it isn't much fun to read.  You don't come to a Harry Potter book to read about Harry sniping at Ron and Hermione -- but that's what you get an awful lot of here.  Similarly, the book's villain, Dolores Umbridge, is truly unpleasant, but not in a fun way -- she's annoying in the way a loathsome, politically minded bureaucrat is, and the tone of the book suffers for it.  You grow to hate her, which is good, but you also grow to hate reading about her, which isn't.Then there's the fact that Harry and Dumbledore go through basically the entire book refusing to speak to or even look at each other, and the fact that Hagrid doesn't show up for hundreds of pages and then, when he does, he's bloody, missing some teeth, and sporting broken ribs and a black eye.  I understand that Rowling wanted to vary the formula, but again, the particular choices she made made the book less enjoyable (for me).The climactic battle is thrilling but hard to follow -- bad enough when it's 10 bad guys against 6 good guys, but when Rowling throws in another 5 characters out of nowhere and you have to follow 21 different moving parts...  I just gave up.And when the smoke all clears, the climactic unraveling disappoints.  Dumbledore's big revelations aren't anything we haven't figured out long ago, and the MacGuffin of the story -- the thing Voldemort and his minions are striving to capture while all the forces of good are trying to keep it safe -- adds up to nothing much.  The big ""weapon"" everyone's so excited about is something that, had Voldemort gotten it, would just have told him he'd done something foolish long ago.  But so what?  How would it have been useful to Voldemort?  How could he have used it as a weapon, or at all?There were some good things, too.  My favorite was the thestrals, invisible winged horses you can only see if you've witnessed a death.  But for every good bit there were two weak ones (the resolution of the Hagrid subplot, for instance, or the way the subplot about the O.W.L. exams was left unresolved), and my overall impression upon finishing the book was...eh.  Just 'eh.'  Years from now, I'll still be telling people about the great twists in CHAMBER OF SECRETS and AZKABAN, but I doubt I'll remember the plot of this one for more than a month.  And, sadly, I won't be looking forward to the sixth volume with nearly as much enthusiasm as I awaited this one.",FALSE,2003,1468
"5477",5,731190,FALSE,"This book is a masterpiece of writing that will again draw back millions of readers to the old-fashioned form of storytelling that takes several hundred sheets of paper, printed and bound to what was called a book in the old days.This huge volume will be read or rather devoured by readers around the world curled into a grand-father-chair, sitting in a train disconnected with the outside world or even under blankets in the shine of a flashlight. The dense plot and the ongoing high level of thrill will keep them mesmerised to the very last page. Take a seat and dive into the truly magical world of the well-known Hogwart's students in their fifth year. Shiver, prevail, suffer and blush together with Harry in the angers and defiant successes of a juvenile, the gruelling fears of an adolescent and the grief of a grown-up along with the first kiss experiences of a confused boy on the brink of manhood.With the first book I already got the impression that the character of Harry and the challenges brought before him in the magical as well as in the Muggle world are of more intensity than the usually applied descriptions of Harry Potters adventures. This is NOT about a little boy-wizard bravely fighting grown-up bad guys and thus becoming a hero. ""Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix"" shows the complex world of the meanwhile fifteen-year old adolescent protagonist with all the disturbing events that can and will happen to a boy this age.The impressively thick and interwoven plot gives Harry no head start into his fifth year in the magical world. Harry is almost instantly threatened to be expelled from Hogwart's for ""under-age magic in front of Muggles"" because he has to save his cousin Dudley. Why are they trying to take away his wand? And how come he had to save Dudley in the first place. Why is Dumbledore not speaking to him anymore?Harry's and Dumbledore's enemies are on the rise on all fronts. Harry and the idea of You-Know-Who's return are systematically ridiculed in the wizard's public opinion. The fear of a secret ""military""-plot through Dumbledore against the Ministry-of-Magic leads to more and more pre-emptive and even totalitarian measurements against the headmaster, his school and the students. The covert uprising of the Death-Eaters inside and outside of the administration leads to a cold-war-like agent battle of the Dark-Arts-Warlocks against the secret Order-Of-The-Phoenix.Harry and his schoolmates, his godfather Sirius and Professor Snape, Professor Gonagall and Minister Fudge, house-elves and giants, Hagrid and the war of centaurs, wherever Harry moves, there is loyalty and treason, love and hate, bravery and cowardice, brilliance and stupidity all mixed up to confuse a mind already shaken by the means of puberty. And above all there are the OWLs exams!Rawling reintroduces old faces with sometimes surprising new roles and carries on the development of the well-known group of juveniles. There is no standstill in this plot and no simplification in the characters. Ron will develop his own hero-role; Hermione can produce a care-and-counsel side of the calibre of Mrs Weasley; Ginny will show an permanently surprising and witted confidence; Dumbledore demonstrates a never seen magical power as well as the capability of grave misjudgements; even Cedric Diggory, the murdered schoolmate, is not just a long forgotten pawn on the chessboard of a past drama plotting, but has become an enduring part of the lives and minds of his former fellows.Thank you for taking your time with this book Ms Rawlings!",FALSE,2003,1469
"5478",4,731192,FALSE,"Harry Potter is as mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore.My first revision was to go back and give this book 4 stars instead of 5.  I did this only because there are 2 more books to go in this series and if things continue as they have so far in the Harry Potter series then the best is yet to come.  I had to leave some room for improvement, although it's hard to imagine how J. K. Rowling will top The Order of the Phoenix.Where to begin? How about number 4 Privet drive.  We find Harry where we always find him at the beginning of each new adventure at home with the Dursleys, and we can guess that eventually he'll end up at Hogwarts.  But as predictable as that journey may seem this book like the others is about an emotional journey for The Boy who Lived.  That life has gone on and now he's facing the most dangerous leg of that voyage, adolescence.Harry is a powder keg waiting to explode.  And long time readers will not be disappointed.  Harry is the perfect teenager, meaning he's defiantly imperfect, but gloriously so.  Speaking personally when I've read the previous books, I've felt these injustices on behalf of Mr. Potter.  I'm surely not the only one whose felt like this is the guy who thwarted Voldemorts' return,  the one who slew the Basilisk, who won the Triwizard Tournament,  show him some respect and just back off!It turns out that Harry is finally coming to realize some of these things and it's a pleasure to watch. In this summer of rage, as the Hulk bounds through the multiplex, we get to see our Hero due his fare share of exploding at those around him.  That for me was the greatest joy of this book; I admit it's a guilty pleasure.  Don't get me wrong Harry isn't always the righteous hero railing against an unjust world, most of the time he's just yelling at his friends.  But seeing Harry come into himself and just let it fly, it's amazing.Oh g-d there is so much in this book, trying to review it is like looking for Easter eggs.  Just when you've think you've found the best one you see another one peaking through the grass.  So now that I've spun my yarn about Harrys rage.  How about what I see poking through the grass right now.  It's the other thing about these novels that intrigues me, there relevance.Its all here in a book about a Boy Wizard who's not quite a boy anymore.  But it couldn't be more relevant.  The abuse of power in dangerous times, the curtailing of personal freedoms for the supposed greater good, misinformation and the media as a tool for those in power.  Certainly for the confused souls out there who wish to ban Potter because of it's glorification of magic, this is the more dangerous message.  Don't believe everything you read and question authority.Lastly let me just state that this book is a great adventure with thrills and chills and blah blah blah....  I certainly don't mean to be dismissive.  Younger readers and anyone who just loves a great story told well will be entertained. But where is it that Harry Potter grabs us?  I would say the heart but that is an easy answer.  This is more than a shared sense of kinship with a long running character whose pain and angst we either remember or are living through at the moment.  It's more than the head too, whatever you read into the plot or themes of this novel, it is much more than an allegory for modern times.  Harry reaches deeper and grabs us by our guts, and rarely has that connection felt so strong and so primal than in The Order of the Phoenix.",FALSE,2003,1471
"5479",5,731192,FALSE,"I am 22, which I suppose makes me older than the average Potter fan, yet thanks to the movies and family I was turned on to the series. I bring this up for 2 reasons. One, I am outside the target age. Two, although I greatly enjoyed the books before, much of the other works I have read compelled me to slight the first four books, I suppose because of their intentional simplicity.Well, Order of the Phoenix, being the account of the 5th year at the school and the same number in the series, not only is a fantastic work of fiction, both for children and the young at heart, but also elevates the entire series.Order begins with an absolute bang when trouble comes to Privet Drive. While the other four books have been slow moving in the beginning as to acquaint and reestablish the reader, Rowling skips the exposition and gets strait into action. Harry is able to escape, however his actions get him in further trouble, and for much of the book, this is how the action is propelled: Harry does the right (or sympathetic) action, but it causes him to get into trouble.As those readers of the series know, the wizard who must not be named has arisen from beyond at the end of Goblet of Fire, and it was Harry who was the witness. However, by the time Harry's fifth term has come about, much doubt has been cast in the wizarding world about the validity of this horror. As such, the Ministry of Magic has begun to interfere with Harry's school, Hogwarts. It is through the Ministry that the perpetually cursed position for Professor for Defense Against the Dark Art's has been filled. The woman who fills the spot turns out to be Harry's worst nightmare, and the central antagonist of the book. Combine the worst teacher in your school experience and combine them with Iago from Othello, and you'll have a good idea.Outside of the basic plot, which is equal or better than the previous four, the storytelling is highly compelling and tautly told. Unlike Goblet of Fire, which got a little boring due to all of its weight, and the first three, which one wished could keep going, Order of the Phoenix never feels to be wasting time with uninteresting plotlines (Hermionie's House Elf Crusade in Goblet was a little too time consuming). Every single incident, subplot, new character is as interesting as the last. This is also not the Harry Potter show either, Fred and George Weasly steal the show every time they appear on the pages, Ron has a great arc as the new Keeper on the Quidditch team, and the members of the Titular order compel from the outsides of Hogwarts.However, this review does not encapsulate the wonder of this book. It is darker than the last, to be sure, but it is much more realistic than before. And as the book becomes darker and the obstacles harder for Harry, the moments of triumph are all the more magnificent.For the first time Harry seems more human than wizard superhero, because the plot works with his flaws and fears as much as it does with his fantastic skills.  It is a story that is humane, wondrous, and at all times, exciting. The book is propelled by its supporting cast in the same way Ender's Game is. Though not quite the triumph of Card's masterwork, this is easily the best of the Potter series, and it may be a while before something will come along so fun and compelling to read that is also so rewarding and emotionally involving.This is the best of the Harry Potter books so far, and the best book in it's genre in decades.",FALSE,2003,1471
"5480",4,731192,FALSE,"Being on a three year publication sabbatical may translate as a definitive change in Rowling's style as her latest HP installment is seemingly driven by the tale's plot rather than her usual focus on characterization. Still, Rowling manages to scribe her lengthiest novel to-date, yet despite promises to the contrary, it results in more questions than answers.That's not to say that Order of the Phoenix was not loaded with a plethora of goodies such as a detailed look at Sirius Black's background. On the contrary, I feel this book had a great deal of exposition unlike its former predecessors, which I think also proved to be its flaw--for I believe that we (as readers) would have rathered other lingering questions answered.In retrospect, my real and only disappointment with the book is that I held certain expectations that were not met. These expectations were fueled much in part by interviews with Rowling herself. The interviews--perhaps how they were edited in US -- implied that there would be a greater emphasis placed on issues that in actuality resulted in just passing passages in a 867 pg. book i.e.--ghosts, snogging, actual death scene; Durselys' secret; someone learning magic late in life; and Lily Potter's big secret.Due to certain plot twists, readers lose the invaluable opportunity to learn more about Harry's parents and what is revealed is really mundane in the way of info. I would have been much more impressed having learned that the Potters were aurors or double agents. Even hearing about Longbottom's parents for the second time around proved far more interesting than this.What I found particularly disheartening as well was the lack of significant character development--the blossoming relationship between Hermione/Ron was all but completely neglected. Is Harry the only one among the trio experiencing a surge of hormones? Only the infamous prophecy got a full chapter and I daresay that it was a wasted one as Dumbledore spent the better half repeating what we as readers were already well aware of.The gimmick of obscuring two of the series' main characters for at least three quaters of the book was just too drawn out as was the conflict surrounding the vilified Umbridge. To that effect, the demise of her imperialist regime was remarkably tidy. Additionally, the denouement too closely resembled the confrontation between Arthur Weasley with Mr. Dursley in Book IV; I would have much preferred a funeral for the deceased especially since the death seemed a bit rushed and forced.On a lighter note, I applaud Rowling for the really radical move of progressing the HP series via this installment into darker depths, as it really promotes the growth of this fantastical world she's built effectively pruning her garden of any initial weeds of stagnation. Furthermore, the spotlight she places on otherwise secondary characters combined with the humorous antics of the Weasley twins form an unexpected treat.Overall, I really enjoyed this book as a Rowling text is never a letdown--granted the author has two books yet to scribe, but it would have been gratifying to have had some of the previously introduced questions answered and a host of others presented for any subsequent sequels. Though one thing is for certain--I will do my utmost to avoid any spoilerish interviews with Ms. Rowling prior to Book VI's debut. No good in reading between the lines if it results in misleading expectations.-Luna =0)",FALSE,2003,1471
"5481",5,731192,FALSE,"Being an avid Harry fan myself, I feel I certainly began Book 5 with some measure of bias for the young protagonist and his magical adventures.  Admittedly, I'm always skeptical of my Harry reviews, as I tend to have a weakness for stories involving wizards as well.  That said, having plunged into the Order of the Phoenix, finishing it in about a day of solid reading, I can safely say that I have no doubt that Harry deserves five stars for his latest wizarding escapades.Its difficult to paraphrase the adventure present in the trials and tribulations of Harry in his 5th year without giving away key points in the plot.  One thing, however, can surely be said, and that is that if you've read and enjoyed any or all of the first four books in the series, you'll most certainly enjoy this newest one.  Not only has Rowling constructed a fresh, intriguing plot full of new characters and adventures, but she has also succeeded in incorporating and embellishing key elements from Harry's earlier years.  These interconnections in plotlines certainly gave me, as I sure it would any avid Harry fan, small jolts of excitement every time I stumbled upon one.  Rowling has created not just a new story with familiar characters, but another exciting episode in an epic saga.Though the conflicts of Harry Potter and his cohorts throughout the Potter series are often based on the fundamental notion of ""good vs. evil,"" Rowling has continually managed to put exciting new spins on the theme, creating complex characters and relationships founded upon this basic idea.  The Order of the Phoenix is no exception, and though the format is slightly different from the previous books, this idea of people fighting for what they believe is good in the world prevails.  Rowling has yet again taken this rudimentary storytelling principle and transformed it into something incredible, and she has done it with nothing short of mastery.I've always found that one of J.K. Rowling's greatest strengths as an author is her remarkable ability to age, and mature characters from year to year at Hogwarts, in such a way that the development of the characters seems to mirror with that of the reader.  This, along with the numerous, every-day situations that Harry finds himself in, make identifying with the story of Harry Potter a given for most readers.  For all the magic and wizardry in the Harry Potter series, the ordinary life of Harry himself is surprisingly down-to-earth.The only negative critique I have of the Order of the Phoenix is the slightly cynical tone that the book takes in the beginning stages of the story.  Though the tone itself matches, in some ways, with Harry's mood, I find it difficult to plow through pages of subtly negative writing.  This is not to say the writing is in itself bad, because it most certainly is not, but the beginning does lack some of the old ""Harry Potter cheerfulness"" present in the first four books.One suggestion for those who haven't read all of the series:  If you're thinking of purchasing this latest book in the Harry Potter series, make sure you've read the first four beforehand.  Throughout the fifth book, there are numerous references to obscure facts explained in the first four.  It won't sound like jibberish if you read it alone, but you certainly won't get the most of the more subtle allusions.A well-deserving five stars for J.K. Rowling's latest work!",FALSE,2003,1471
"5482",4,731190,FALSE,"Well, The Order of the Phoenix has been a long time coming, and I think most people will agree that it was worth the wait simply to be with Harry, Ron and Hermione at Hogwart's once again.  To bide the time, we've all been reading volumes 1 - 4 over and over again, and it's a relief to have some fresh material!  J.K. Rowling is still able to charm us with her descriptions of the delightful mysteries of Hogwarts, and we do get more of an in-depth look at wizard academics since Harry is now in his fifth year and will take his O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels).  These are the least of his worries, however, in the midst of Lord Voldemort's further rise to power, the development of the Order of the Phoenix, and the placement of a new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor by an increasingly unsympathetic Ministry of Magic.  Bulging, toad-like Professor Umbridge is the fifth new Defense against the Dark Arts professor, and most of the book is actually devoted to her reign of administrative terror at Hogwarts and less to building up fear and anxiety of Voldemort and his Death Eaters.Though definitely satisfying, the fifth volume is more descriptive and not as action-packed and imaginative as the Goblet of Fire which culminated in a hair-raising duel between Harry and Voldemort.  However, readers who were asking for more details of school life will be pleased.  It seems more like the ""middle"" novel, which is what I would have expected the fourth to be, but its purpose is to answer some important questions:What specifically ties Harry and Voldemort together?What is the Prophecy?What does Dumbledore reveal to Harry that he should have revealed years ago?And for those who have been left dangling at Rowling's teaser:WHO dies? (If you read carefully enough, you'll be able to predict this in the earlier part of the book)The revelations are not breath-taking, but they do stretch out our current knowledge and prepare us for the real drama which will hopefully take place in volumes six and seven.The tone of the book is a bit different.  Evil does come even more uncomfortably close to Harry, but it is not a darker tone that makes the book different.  It's the fact that Harry's growing up and starting to suffer through adolescent angst.  He's got more of a rebellious temper in this volume and is no longer the sweet, quieter Harry of the first volume.  Can't say that we blame him, he's been through quite a lot and it's not over yet.  Part of growing up involves the realization that parents are capable of mistakes.  Harry accidentally finds this out through special ""Occlumency"" lessons with his most dreaded teacher, Snape, who hates Harry just as much as he ever has.  A more fun part of growing up involves a first kiss, and Harry goes through all of the awkward, embarrassing and hopeful moments leading up to it.  Nevertheless, despite these changes, we can still depend on Hermione's obsessive studying and clever help (although she's still involved in S.P.E.W.), Ron's faithful friendship, the antics of Fred and George, and the grandfatherly support of Dumbledore whose wisdom and lawyerly wits in this volume ultimately save Harry and Hogwart's from a great deal of trouble.  However, the full range of Voldemort's wrath has yet to be released in books six and seven.  At least we now have over 850 pages to read over and over again until book six comes out....",FALSE,2003,1469
"5483",5,731190,FALSE,"This is the rare sort of book that has the same effect on me as the Lord of the Rings saga, and with a few less pages. I really couldn't put it down, untill the morning news hit the door, telling me that it was six a.m. But by Sunday I'd finished it. Sadly, don't expect much to be answered in this. The book truely creates more questions than it resolves. Another warning: Gone is the sense that has held true in the last books, the sense of some firm ground to stand on. There are no contants now, to look on with calm, even when Harry's time is crazy. In this novel, even the solid, unchanging system of Hogwarts, family, and Quidditch are turned upside-down. The death, which everyone has been contemplating, is a horrible jolt. We really barely knew the person. The secondary problems almost overshadow the bigger issues, and Neville (always my favorite character) finnally is all I knew him to be. Poor Harry is now weaker, due to the trauma at last getting to him, and is finding it harder to bear the pressure. Still incredably good at remaining in controll, even with the dreams, and the despicable Umbridge, etc. All in all, as  a fan of psychology, mystery, and fantasy, this book glows in these, and is one of the best books I've ever read.

"5484",5,731191,FALSE,"I give this story five stars somewhat advisedly. If you are not already a fan of the series don't start here; you need to be familiar with the previous four books to understand the characters and situations in this one. Those of you who are fans may be a little disappointed at the beginning. A handful of interesting new characters are introduced, but they're somewhat undeveloped. Much beloved old characters return, but they're more peripheral and we don't get to spend much time with them. The story never gets to the Weasley family home The Burrow. Most jaring of all, the star of the show kind of becomes an Angry Teenager With An Attitude.Or maybe it's better that Harry has an attitude adjustment; it  doesn't make complete sense that a boy who is abused and humiliated by his guardians for the first eleven years of his life, survives four murder attempts, and is pilloried in the Wizard press, would always be so good natured. Often as not when an entertainment property establishes itself as a franchise, fans don't want the lead character's disposition to change, so Rowling deserves credit for risking the disapproval of millions of readers by moving in that direction. In a similar vein, we are also treated for the first time to a degree of emotional estrangement between Harry and his leading surrogate fathers, Albus Dumbledore and Sirius Black.Fortunately, Harry's friends Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and -surprise!- Ginny Weasley are on hand to drag him back into line. In fact, it is one of the small pleasures of Order of the Phoenix that each develops as a human being without having a ""Coming of Age"" theme overwhelm the plot.  And in this book he needs his friends more than ever. Political intrigue, paranoia, power mongering, treachery, and simple bone headedness mushroom across the wizarding world, much of it embodied by Dolores Umbridge.  She is ostensibly the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, but is in reality a one woman goon squad and toady for Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, who fears headmaster Albus Dumbledore's insistance that the evil dark wizard Lord Voldemort has returned is part of a scheme to replace him.  As it was Harry who played a wholly unwilling role in Voldemort's return (at the end of Goblet Of Fire), against whom do you suppose Ms Umbridge cruelly, maliciously, and repeatedly takes umbrage?The barest bones of the story established, her are some other fun things you will encounter along the way:-Some of the best, most pointed practical joking by Fred & George Weasley, who close their Hogwarts education in style.-The emergence of Ginny Weasley as a feisty, intelligent, and capable young witch.-The emergence of Neville Longbottom as a true Gryffindor, not just a hapless bungler.-Ron's shaky debut as keeper on the Gryffindor quidditch team.-An impromptu, clandestine class in defense spells led by Harry.-A rocky school romance between Harry and Cho Chang.-Luna ""Loony"" Lovegood, a 4th year Ravenclaw.-Our first look inside St. Mungo's Hospital.-An at times nerve-wracking foray into the Department of Mysteries.In point of fact Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix gets better as it goes along, and if you are a fan it will have fully drawn you in long before you get to page 870.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5485",3,731191,FALSE,"I have to admit that I was surprised at the outpouring of favorable reviews from critics for this fifth book in the Harry Potter series.  Let me first say that I'm a big fan of the series and have appreciated the high caliber of writing as well as JK Rowling's ability to stimulate our children's intellect. Every member of our family is a huge fan and we happily waited until midnight to purchase three copies of the latest book (we can't wait for each other to finish).  However, when my wife, my 14 year-old daughter, and I had finished with the book we all had similar feelings about it.My primary disappointment was that while I actually looked forward to 870 pages of Harry Potter, I felt that the book could have gotten rid of half of those pages and not lost any important part of the story line.  In fact, it would have helped to keep the pace going.  Too often the reader is led through some sub-plot that, in the end, had no bearing at all on the story at hand.  Even characters were introduced that you waited to have some role that never materialized.The second criticism would be a apparent discontinuity with the previous four books.  In the first four books I felt JK Rowling did an excellent job in keeping the Harry Potter universe together and having pieces from Book Four meld in perfectly with the foundation established by the previous books.  In this book, however, the entire universe seems to have changed in the month since Harry last left school.  People who were regarded as saviors are now villified and institutions that were the keepers of the moral flame have been reduced to petty political infighting and backstabbing.I understand to some extent what the author was trying to accomplish but it was too much to swallow.  There was so much change so quickly that it didn't make any sense.  Without giving the story away ... I didn't believe the whole Percy sub-plot (if he's that petty and power-hungry, how did he end up in Gryffyndor instead of Slytherin?  Did the Sorting Hat make a mistake?).  I also didn't buy the Cornelius Fudge turnaround either ... again it was too much too soon with little basis for the bizarre change of heart.  Likewise, the Ministry of Magic's campaign with the school was too far over the top.  It got to be ridiculous.I was also disappointed in Harry's new ""darker"" persona.  While people have written that it made him more complex and mature ... I felt the exact opposite.  I thought he came off as a whining petulant child.  He lashed out at both his peers and elders seemingly without justification.  The constant ""all caps"" SCREAMING on every other page got old very quickly as well.  Where was the Harry Potter from the first four books who marshalled his resources, never gave up, and looked for solutions where he could find them?  I felt he took a major step back in this book.Even the ""tragic death"" we have all been waiting for was anti-climatic.  It seemed to be forced ... as if JK Rowling said at the end of the book ""Okay, someone needs to die ... who will it be?""I still enjoyed the book and give it three stars as it was an average read.  It was just disappointing to get an ""average"" read from such an anticipated novel from such a great writer.  However, I know I'll be waiting at midnight for Book Six when it comes out.",FALSE,2003,1470

Hermione, Ron, and Sirius have been ordered by no less than Dumbledore himself to tell him nothing in their letters, and Harry is becoming angry with his exclusion and his uncle and aunt's treatment of him.  Harry is now fifteen, and we find that not only has the world grown darker, but Harry as well. In the book, he seems to be constantly tottering on the very edge of the ""Dark Side,"" and we see him becoming increasingly resentful of the restrictions put on him by Dumbledore and the rest, and terrible, totally unpredictable things begin to happen to Harry in this book as he becomes more willful, outspoken, and determined to convince people of his truths and feelings, whether they be right or wrong. (No, I'm not just speaking of Voldemort's return!)  Harry's connection to Voldemort grows frightfully in this volume of the series, and throughout the whole book he is haunted by a dream of a single, mysterious (in more ways than one) black door, as well as visions of himself as a deadly snake.

"5488",4,731206,FALSE,"First of all, do not read any of the following reviews unless you want the plot ruined.  Too many people give parts of the story away or blurt out the climax.I disagree with those persons who rated this book poorly simply because they did not like the ending or that the book was too dark.  This book is more emotionally complex than the previous four books because Harry is more emotionally complex.  Harry has emotions that many 15 year olds would have, which certainly includes angst, hatred, hurt, insecurity, sexuality, and fear.  Yet, like many 15 year olds he also has strong positive emotions that carry him through his personal demons like loyalty, trust, love, and sympathy.The complexity of the emotions certainly makes the book longer because Rowling has set the stage for Harry's emotional transition from childhood to adolescence by having several concurrent threads that pose personal dilemmas.  Rowling can certainly tell a story so these threads weave together relatively well, which give the book substance and depth.However, certain threads become distracting and at the end of the book do not add to the plot except to show Harry's emotional ranges.  Specifically, his relationship with a girl does not really develop and turns out to be quite shallow.  Granted, writing about falling in love at a meaningful level is difficult when a significant percentage of the target audience is younger than 13.My most critical evaluation is that this book is really about setting the stage for the rest of the series.  The plot seemed created purely as a backdrop to Harry's emotions and unfortunately resulted in several plot holes, which is a bit frustrating because Rowling said the delay in publication was due to having to fix this very same problem.For example, Harry is given a contraption to communicate with someone important but without explanation forgets all about it until it is too late to use.  This is an extremely key part of the book because of the consequences to a main character due to a miscommunication.Another plot hole is Dumblemore's incomprehensible neglect in not telling Harry the key to the whole underlying plot even though Dumblemore gave numerous warnings himself and through others.  His explanation at the end for not speaking clearly was completely unsatisfactory.  It would have been a better dilemma for Harry to know Dumblemore's reasons yet ignore them out of ego, concern for others, or pure curiosity.Also, Harry's running to the ghosts to look for hope at the end was the result of Rawling's tying up loose ends without adding anything substantively.  Although, it was unnecessary since I do not think the demise of one of the characters is final...anything is possible with magic.Nevertheless, I could not put the book down and enjoyed the story, which ultimately is the most important part.

"5489",5,731189,FALSE,"The answer to the question would be a yes. I spent a very enjoyable seven hours this weekend reading Phoenix and was generally very impressed. As an eighteen year old I like to think I'm above children's books but Harry Potter appeals to everyone and it's a great piece of escapsim. There are only a few quibbles I have to make with the story - I'll try not to spoil anything for you!1 - Rowling's attempts to make Harry grow up are sometimes awkward and seem to be trying a bit too hard to make them 'cool' and relevant to today's teens. Harry's pairing off with a girl - who shall remain nameless - also struck me as rather unlikely and unrealsitic - as was the fact that Ginny seemed to have a couple of boyfriends2 - The major death we were promised was a disappointment, Rowling may have cried when she killed this character off but I didn't, I think Cedric's death at the end of book 4 was far more emotive. I was expecting a death which would chnage the status quo a bit more than this one.3 - There's an incedent with some horse-like creatures at Hogwarts which can only be seen by someone who has witnessed a death - Harry hasn't been able to see them at Hogwarts until this year, but hang on I thought Harry had already witnessed the death of his parents many years ago. Perhaps he didn't remember being so young at the time, but I thought that was a bit suspicious.Well those are my main quibbles, that and the fact that the novel didn't seem to invent as many fun things as usual - like every flavoured beans - there was no trip to Diagon Alley and there seemed to be too many characters featured in the novel.Well now for the good things, the size of the novel is a great plus - it may seem immense at first but you'll rush through it, trust me - and it really allows to believe you're at Hogwarts for several hours. I thought some of the angry Harry sections were really well written and showed a more pschological insight into Rowling's hero. The plot was really good, with lots of twists and very unpredictable; Rowling always manages to create something new each time despite the forumulaic go-to-Hogwarts-defeat-Voldemort constraints. The constant Ron/Hermione tension is also well written, but I hope it develops in the next book otherwise it could get a bit samey. I also thought Fred & George were hilarious & provided lots of comic interludes. I also loved the 'Quibble' newspaper - you'll see what I mean when I read it. The prefects episode was not what I expected and well written and Malfoy just keeps on getting more deliciously evil. Rowling also managed to give the quidditch matches a nice twist as well.So in conclusion read this book - or at least start reading book one - if you haven't yet - and you'll soon be hooked. I just hope Rowling doesn't take four years over the next two books - because I'll be twenty-six if she does! Enjoy this book, I know you've got many happy hours of escapism ahead of you.PS: After reading the book I gave it my fifteen year old sister to read, she's been reading it solidly all day and she NEVER reads so there's another recommendation of how good it is.

"5490",5,731190,FALSE,"This fifth installment of the Harry Potter series was the darkest yet, but I still was unable to put it down and simply devoured it.  The fourth book leaves the reader knowing that Voldemort is back, but the wizarding world is not convinced.  While Harry has been at 4 Pivot Drive for summer holiday, the Daily Prophet has been printing stories discrediting Harry and Dumbledore.  And Harry's return to the wizarding world is not on a pleasant note, which sets the tone of the novel.  Harry  first meets the Order of the Phoenix (a secret wizarding group that rivals the Death Eaters)after he recieves some owls from the Ministry and has to go with the Order to his new summer lodging--the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix.  Right off the bat, the portrayal of Potter in this book is quite different from the past.  Potter's much more quick tempered and a bit resentful.  Potter is seen as a typical teenager who is going through adolescence with some hormonal imbalances.  During the summer he isolates himself and gets into some arguements.  He continues to do this throughout the story.  Once back at Hogwarts, his life doesn't get better.  The Ministry has hired Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and she makes Rita (from Goblet of Fire) look like an angel.  (Umbridge is a character who will definately get on everyone's nerves.)  She starts off as just a teacher, but quickly becomes the High Inquisitioner and makes Hogwarts her own.  Without giving too much away, basically Harry has to deal with Umbridge, Snape (who can be looked upon actually as somewhat of a good guy in this novel), a multitude of disbeliving witches and wizards, O.W.L.s, Draco (who is now a prefect), becoming a true teenager, teaching the ""D.A."" (a response to Umbridge), Cho Chang and her imbalances, and of course Voldemort.  The connection between Voldemort and Harry has reached more than just his scar hurting, too.  Dreams and ""mind reading"" (and trickery) play a huge part in the novel as well.  And Dumbledore finally has a sort of heart to heart with Harry and completely explains the burning question as to why Harry lived against Voldemort's attack and goes deeper into the meaning of his scar.  Yes, all the rumors are true: an important character does die (and I was heartbroken!). What is really heartbreaking is how avoidable the whole situation is and the way the incident develops.  Also, as the whole incident is brought on by Potter himself, and it shows a different side of Harry--his tragic flaw (being too rash and not thinking things through).  Overall this book leaves you slightly depressed but you're on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next installment.  There are twists and turns, some sad others kind of pleasant, but it is certainly a rather upsetting ending for Harry.  It makes the reader want to return to Hogwarts for Harry's 6th year just as much as Harry wants to.  The book is written in Rowling's typical fantastic style which makes an 870 page book actually a pretty fast read (I must admit I finished it within 24 hours of picking it up--it is that good!).  It truly makes you laugh, cry, and hungry for more.",FALSE,2003,1469
"5491",5,731190,FALSE,"That alone should say how well thought out and how well written a book this is. I've been eagerly anticipating the fifth novel fo the Harry Potter series since I finished the 4th one ( The Goblet of Fire)which I burned through, and now, after a terribly long wait, it is here. I just finished it earlier today, and WOW. I sat back for almost an hour after completion, just taking it all in. I expected a deeper plot and a darker atmosphere similar, but a little more so than that of the 4th book... Never did I expect it to be this dark nor this good. Harry Potter is one of my favorite series and I adore every book in it, but even this (with my high expectations) was a very, very, pleasent surprise. There are constant plot twists, more so than in any other book in the series and you really get emotionally involved with the characters. (One character I dare say aggrivated me more than any other in any book I have ever read, you will know who.)After reading through the first 4 you have a basic idea of whos who, who they are, and how they would react to things, thus with them being so fleshed out prior to this book, they now can really develop the relationships betwean characters as they hardly need to develop the ones shes already written about. (Save for maybe a few touch ups of how they are acting as they grow older, normal adolescent stages such as tempers are very commonly mentioned so you know just where the character stands in how they react with their surroundings and their age [growing up].) The new characters, specifically Luna Lovegood I more than welcomed, however one new edition I (as well as the Hogwarts students, not the Slytherins go figure)simply loathed. Harry gets himself a girlfriend which doesn't work out as well as I would have liked it to but at the same time seemed more realistic then if it was all just peachy keen and happy... So I have very mixed feelings about it but hope he gets another chance with her in the next novel. He's also faced with the dividing of the schools opinions on him and if he is a liar, or telling the truth of Voldemort's return. He is also constantly looking up to the father he never knew. harry is constantly tring to be as much like his father as he can by listening to stories about him and going out of his way for people to say he is just like his father.  Not to mention his repeated nightmare of a doorway at the end of a hall that he had all summer and throughout school which he simply cannot make heads or tales out of. I don't want to give out too many details but as you can see there is a fair deal on Harry's plate (much more than even I described [much much more]) and Harry is constantly fighting throughout this novel, again, more than any before. In the end, however, it is very bittersweet. Harry has just completed the most difficult year of his life, however now you know of the dim fate he must accept, as well as the death of a beloved character and Voldemorts complete return. I cannot wait for the sixth novel and all I can do is pray she gets back on her original plan of a book a year, but if the next one is anywhere near as long as this one, then it will be longer probobly.",FALSE,2003,1469
"5492",5,731192,FALSE,"Hey, um, the new Harry Potter book is out, hasn't anyone noticed?  Anyway, Harry Potter 5 basically picks up where #4 left off.  In case you haven't noticed, all five Harry Potter books have been getting progressively longer, but I think there's something of a cut-off between the later books and the earlier ones.  For one, both 4 and 5 are over 700 pages.  Harry is also older in them, with his crush on Cho a little expanded (especially in 5), and a bit of teenage angst.  The emotions in 4 and 5 are often darker and more complex.  Perhaps also Rowling has developed a more mature writing style.However, Harry Potter 5 is also quite a bit different from its predecessors.  Like the review above says, its probably the darkest of the series so far, and almost certainly the most frustrating (unlike the other books, the end isn't much better either).  As hinted at the end of 4, in 5 there is practically a civil war between Dumbledore and Fudge, although Dumbledore plays a more backseat role in 5 through most of the story.  Several new characters are introduced as well, notably Luna Lovegood, a somewhat spacy fourth year student, Dolores Umbridge, who replaces Snape as the most evil teacher at Hogwarts, and several members of the Order of the Phoenix, but I'm not giving away what that is (you find out pretty quickly anyway), while older characters like Snape and Sirius are a bit expanded, and inter-character relationships become rather more complex.Critics of The Order of the Phoenix will point out that the plot is probably the least focused of the series, as the others are closely bound to the time of year, the next Hogsmeade visit, or the events of the Triwizard Tournament, while in Phoenix, the reader has a tendency to forget what time of the year it is (the book doesn't even mention Halloween, a major event in the others), and find themselves a little disoriented.  But, I can say for Rowling that she has managed to be increasingly inventive in her storytelling, and that perhaps this is due to her more complex storyline.  Another criticism is that, especially when dealing with Harry's emotions, the book has a greater tendency to ramble than any of the others.  Again though, Harry often feels anger, frustration, and loss throughout the book, and these long descriptions are necessary to justify what could otherwise be seen as rash decisionmaking on his part.  Finally, Harry Potter 5 demands a more complete knowledge of the other books than any of the others, which you could more or less read out of order (I read 3 before 2).  Reading 5 before 4 would probably be confusing.  Again though, this is to be expected as the series becomes longer and more complex.Overall Harry Potter 5 is a thoroughly entertaining read, fully deserving of its place in the Harry Potter series, although I suggest you read it only after the other four.  One last note, it is over 850 pages long, but as I'm sure any avid Harry Potter fan will know, the pages fly by.  I consider myself a relatively slow reader, and I managed to finish in 2 days.

"5495",3,731191,FALSE,"I ordered this hefty volume way back in February and was thrilled when it arrived, right on time, by 1 pm the day it was released.  I devour books like potato chips, so I finished it within a few days, and while it is a solid Harry tale, there are some problems with ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""Firstly, it's been long enough since book four came out that those of us who tore through that one three years ago could do to reread it before hitting this one.  Don't remember what the O.W.L.s are?  Can't recall where Hagrid went at the end of last year?  While Rowling does a decent job of reminding us about the finer points, it almost seems like, even with 870 pages, something is missing.The missing piece?  The joy.  The first book, and this is an aspect the movie carefully reflected, is absolutely filled with delightful, whimsical, magical details.  ""Order of the Phoenix,"" on the other hand, delves not only into minutiae we're not necessarily interested in -- since Rowling now has time to luxuriate in writing, not stuck in coffee shops scribbling on napkins, she seems to believe that leading readers through every class the students take each day of the week, for several weeks, is worthwhile -- but also, more, into real darkness.That's right.  This supposed children's novel is chock-full of unhappiness.  Without including specific spoilers, I can say that there is death, there is torture, there is insanity, there is anger and dissension between friends, there is teen angst, there is horror.  Every character we have ever met, more or less, shows up at one point or another, and they are often found yelling at each other (WHICH IS USUALLY OVER-EMPHASIZED BY PUTTING ENTIRE SENTENCES IN CAPS) or saying things ""loudly,"" which seems to be Rowling's catchphrase, along with ""softly,"" when describing how someone is speaking.  Surely she could have used a thesaurus occasionally.In all, the book is a quality story, reassuringly printed with the usual Harry fonts and the charming small illustrations at the start of each chapter, but without any uplifting moments.  It was the delight that both author and readers found in exploring the wizardry world along with Harry that made the first few books marvelous; this time, an older, unhappier, darker boy and his weary companions are all we have on a tiring journey.  Expect a longlasting feeling of foreboding as you read, and not that much new insight.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5497",5,731189,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix was surprsingly well-written; sophisticated character development and thematic challenges are woven together into a captivating story.  Unlike Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the writing is concise, and thankfully, unneeded details are omitted.  Every moment of HP5 seems important and, in the scheme of the series, probably is.  Previously flat characters take on new roles, and already dynamic characters manage to become more controversial.However, as tensions boil and the eventual implications of gradual changes in the wizarding world are made clear, the reader realizes that for the majority of the book, few major events take place.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix is fascinating because it takes risks that the first four books in the series were too scared to take, and its format is significantly different.  Nevertheless, its atmosphere is that of a foundation to be laid for the last two books.  It seems that the novel sets the stage for what are likely to be dramatic and dark events in future installments of the Harry Potter series.An interesting story for children, and a query into human nature for older readers.  Read it.",FALSE,2003,1468
"5498",4,731187,FALSE,"...so what?  No, I won't give it 5 stars for the mere fact that I know it could be shorter.  Everyone who says that there is a lot of useless details, maybe you're right, but haven't we always praised Rowling for her rich attention to detail?  Weren't the things you loved in the first book the crazy characters and environments so beautifuly described?  You can't fault her for trying to provide the readers with something that we've said we loved.  In case you didn't know, that's hypocritical.  To address the other issues that people have had with the book, namely Harry's new more whiny character: he's a teenager now, for crying out loud!  Maybe many of the people who read these books aren't old enough to know what it's like to be a teenager, but for us adult readers, we know.  We were probably exactly like that.  One of the best parts of Rowling's work is her ability to show the coming of age of her characters in this series (an excellent example of the bildungsroman).  If the characters were to retain the same qualities that they posessed at the start of the series without developing at all, she would have failed as a writer.I have only one other quibble with her, and that was the death at the end.  It was not as predictable as some people may believe; however, I still am left wondeing exactly why it had to occur.  Despite this, I am more willing to take it with a grain of salt and hope that it will be explained in future installments.  I am willing to withold my judgement on this point until I see where it leads, we must remember that this is a *series* and as such, not every thing will be wrapped up neatly at the end of each installment.While this particular installment does not have quite the same level of adventure in it, Rowling still does an excellent job keeping the reader hooked, wanting to find out more.  She also, as in the previous installments, manages to inject important themes into her work (racism, government controlled education...the Inquisition, anyone?) along with the classic theme of good versus evil.While this is not my favorite in the series (Prisoner of Azkaban, holds that place) it is still a fun read and better written than most adult fiction you will ever find.",FALSE,2003,1466
"5499",5,729771,FALSE,"I don't normally read ""children's books,"" but I have always had a soft spot for fantasy, my favorite genre (particularly books involving magic and talking mice, for some reason).  I had never intended to ready  any of the Harry Potter books, but my mother, acting on a whim, bought the  first two volumes for me, saying that they were very popular.  The books  sat unread in my room for weeks, until late one Wednesday night, when I  read both books, finishing at 3 AM, and neglecting to translate my Cicero  assignment.  The books were great!  I immediately bought the 3rd  installment, which I read immediately that afternoon.  I find it easy to  identify with Harry Potter, who reminds me of myself sometimes.  Particularly, I enjoy references to Latin in the books (such as the first  example, caput draconis, head of Draco, in book 1.)  The twisted plot at  the end of Prisoner of Azkaban intrigued me, compelling me to read the last  few chapters multiple times to fully grasp all of it winding lines.  The  Prisoner of Azkaban took a step away from what I view as the first and  second books' major fallacy: the repetitive plot line.  Potter has a bad  time with his family, goes to school, has trouble with a permutation of  Voldemort, defeats Voldemort, and gets congratulated by everbody, helping  his house win the Cup.  Blah Blah Blah. The third book remediated this  problem, since it wasn't clear who the villan was until the very end.  My  larges gripe with the Harry Potter books is now length.  I read the books  in a little over two hours each.  Its rather torturous to wait for weeks on  end for two hours of enjoyment.  I wish the Harry Potter books could be  more like the books of Ayn Rand in that area: enjoyable and interesting,  but abysmally long.  (My average reading time for Atlas Shrugged is  surpassed only by War and Peace...snore...snore...)  To end on a positive  note, I am happy to award my five stars to ""Harry Potter and the  Prisoner of Azkaban"" in appreciation to Rowlings' correction of some  of the problems with the first books and my opinion that the Harry Potter  books are VERY ENJOYABLE!  I dread what will happen after the seventh book,  when Harry has graduated from school.  Will he be a professor, or set out  on his own?  Or Rowling just (sob! sob! sob!) terminate the series?

Yet you might be surprised by how little actually happens...As soon as I finished The Goblet of Fire, I thought to myself: ""Good work, J.K. - no more fooling around - the stage is finally set for the real action."" I was dissappointed however to find that the Order of the Phoenix is stuck somewhere in the stale regions of Rowling's ultimate vision. Even the most prominent plotline seems far too insignificant to be worth a year of devoted attention from both Voldemort's supporters and their adversaries.Also, though the pages climb well into the 800s - practically no new information was revealed. What little I learned about Harry and Voldemort seemed uninteresting, tangled, illogical, and cliched. Don't be fooled by that excerpt Scholastic released, where Dumbledore tells Harry: ""Sit down, I'm going to tell you everything."" When I finally got to this point in the book I was thinking to myself ""is that IT?"" The big revelation is nothing but a disappointing confabulation, seemingly thrown in at the last minute.The structure I won't get into very much, but rest assured that this one follows the same pattern as all the others. As usual, Rowling likes to throw in seemingly insignificant details at the beginning that ultimately manifest as part of the larger plot. While plausible, they were neither interesting nor especially deep. Again, a haphazard effort on the author's part to create complexity where there was very little.J.K.'s new characters were mostly bland. Only a couple of Harry's new friends (and foes) were exempt from this judgement. I was very happy, though, with her portrayal of the original cast.In sum, this book is yet another of five stage-setters - so don't expect a lot of big stuff (though there was one event that particularly gripped me). While I cannot say that Rowling is a particularly groundbreaking or talented writer, her work still manages to draw me in somehow: I mourn and laugh with her characters as if the world is my own, and my high regard for her work as a whole remains unmarred.

It just didn't feel like Harry Potter. I think most of it was the shock that the book was actully out, after I'd been waiting for three years.  I went back and read it, and you know what? I totally fell head over heels in love with it! If you didn't like Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, READ IT AGAIN! You'll look at it totally differently.  J.K. Rowling brought in a whole new cast of cool characters. Nymphadora Tonks, who can change her apperance at will, the real Mad-Eye Moody, Mundungus Fletcher, Arabella Figg, a Squib, and, my personal favorite, Luna Lovegood! You also hear more about old characters, such as Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, whom change quite a bit in this novel.  New magical animals appear too. Such as giants, although they aren't really animals, but you do hear quite a bit about them, I won't go anymore there, and thestrals, reptilian-like  black winged horses, of which only people who have seen death can see. I loved the thestrals particularly!  A fresh, sparkling tale, darker and deeper than the others.  Many people were disturbed by Harry's anger outbursts. But think about it. What would you do if you were cooped up with the three relatives you have and hate, had to stay with them for most of the summer holidays, not hearing a word about the wherabouts of Lord Voldemort and his supporters? You'd get angry! You'd release that fury which has built up inside you over long, miserable months! Girls cry about stuff like that, guys get angry. It's really not unnatural. It wasn't about making the book dramatic, it was about keeping the emotions realistic.  This book was wonderful.

WOW, was I impressed, and I had to literally stop myself from rushing out to buy the second and third books immediately.  I  paced myself, and am now glad I really took the time to enjoy each book  fully before going on to the next.These books may not be ""up  there"" with Tolkien (but come on, who is?), but they are easily  comparable with Roald Dahl or the Oz series.These books are smart.  They  don't talk down to the reader.  They use an admirably rich vocabulary for  books geared at an audience of kids.  Take a look at the names of  characters and places, for example, and you'll see a lot of funny word-play  (many of these are based on Latin vocabulary), which hopefully will  introduce readers to the delights of the English language.Then there's  the characters.  They're fully-realized, three-dimensional, and thoroughly  entertaining.  You almost feel like you know them.  Harry is the hero, but  he's far from Wonder Kid-- he has his doubts, fears, and struggles, just  like  everyone else, but he prevails because he's smart, courageous, and  willing to bend rules when he knows it's necessary.  His friends are  classic loyal sidekicks, but they have their own distinct personalities.  And the supporting cast is just fantastic.Most wonderful of all is  Rowling's consistent ability to transform the ordinary.  In her world, the  most everyday things become magical.Her humor is dry, and very English.  Readers who 'get' British humor will find these stories especially  entertaining.The third book develops further some of the things  presented in the first two books, while clearly leaving some threads  unresolved for the rest of the series.  Rowling is an excellent  storyteller; she knows exactly how much to give and exactly how much to  hold back; the books are superbly paced; surprises linger around each  corner.While each story is at heart a struggle of good vs. evil, there  are many gray areas.  Many of the antagonistic characters (eg, Snape) are  simply motivated by their own agendas.  Everyone has a backstory that  influences their behavior.  And nothing comes too easily to the heroes;  they are forced to rely on their wits and intelligence in order to  prevail.In short, these books may not be literary ""classics""  in the sense that word is typically used.

But I have just finished this book and the biggest indicator to my thoughts on it must be that fact that I read it very quickly, despite its over 700 pages.I am glad to see that Rowling has flexed her pen-muscles a bit here, with a large vocabulary, some very beautifully written passages, and increasingly mature themes that deal subtly with issues such as beaurocracy, sense of duty, and a bit of ethics and morality. I think Graham Greene or Evelyn Waugh would be proud of some of the bitterness that can be found within these pages. Of course, most of it is spelled out to you and is a bit too easily digestible, but one must remember this is a children's book after all! Rowling continues to amaze us with her incredible imagination - her world stitches together so neatly and logically, it is a work of art in that sense.The romantic sideline is exactly that - a sideline. It reveals a side to Harry that I'm sure his fans have longed to learn about, and Rowling handles it with a fair amount of grace, but she directs your thoughts to adolescent social behaviour in a rather mechanical way. Don't expect Catcher in the Rye or Le Grand Mealnes!Rowling has diluted her plot too much with trivial scenes. Personally, I find Hagrid a bit boring. And how can Rowling justify placing all these scenes about wizarding exams and tedious school life between scenes dealing with death, life after death, and the end of the world and all that?! I say to you, JK: Raise your game! You (particularly through Dumbledore) treat Harry as a mature boy, able to deal with anything deadly or dangerous - so why does he care if he's caught in the corridor without his pencils properly sharpened?!  Again, perhaps I am being unfair writing from an adult's perspective.One thing I am grateful to the author for is that her books don't all end too happily. This sounds a bit nihilistic, but I think it's the trade-offs, the compromises and the sacrifices that really inspire and move people, and will get young people talking and probably arguing about the themes in this book. Perhaps I read it too quickly, but I remember that the Goblet of Fire was more shocking.However, at the end of the day, if you're a fan, you'll enjoy it simply because it enlarges and enrichens the whole world that you would probably love to be a part of.",FALSE,2003,1471

In a way, I was terrified to read it- so much has been building up, so many expectations.  But it is now read and finished on my bedside table.  And I loved every word of it.  It is incredibly difficult to write a convincing review without giving out spoilers.Phoenix has been called time and time again, ""the darkest one yet.""  I mean, that fits and everything, but it can give the wrong impression.  Dark themes, monsters, and characters have been a part of Harry Potter since Book 1.  It's just that Phoenix takes it to a different level.  It becomes just as much of an internal struggle as well.  There are many new emotions and problems Harry has to wrap his brain around.  Be it the confusing ways of girls, or horrible dreams that come true, or a blazing temper he is hard-pressed to control, Harry has finally arrived in the world of teenage angst.Call me crazy, but Harry's temper tantrums are some of my favorite parts in the book.  So many things come crashing down in his world, and when he starts talking in all-capitals...I can totally relate.  My adrenaline starts pumping, and I only wish I was by his side to yell with him.Book 5 isn't just about emotions (although they do play a bigger part than in any of the other books).  Rowling still manages to surprise us with new characters, new faces, new creatures, and new plot twists.  As an internet junkie who has pored over predictions and guesses for Phoenix, I can safely say that there are enough surprises in this book for anyone to do a double-take at least once.  That's another thing about this book, the mystery and suspense.  I've heard some newspaper critics say that the book is long-winded because it throws little jolts in at the end of every chapter(to the point that it becomes predictable), under the pretense of keeping the reader interested.  Honestly.  What is wrong with not being able to put a book down?  I love the small torture of having to stop reading right when it gets good, in order to eat dinner(something that seems so insignificant after reading Harry's adventures).Book 5 is Rowling's best yet.

J.K Rowling has shown once again her skill and evident flair for creating such a brilliantly portrayed world once more.But, in this new novel, Rowling has left behind the popular almost childlike form of Harry and his fellow characters, allowing a more realistic, opinionated & more easily identifiable individual Harry to emerge.  As in the 4 previous novels, Harry has always been portrayed as a child, somewhat confused about his place and identity. This does continue in volume 5 but to a much lesser extent. We see Harry emerge from this cocoon of a slightly predictable childish character to a rebellious teenager.The fifth novel sees Harry growing up very fast and developing sound opinions and ideas of his own accord. It is essentially about transition. The transition from late childhood to the eye opening age of 15 and beyond, where sadly, the world is not as easy and care free as a child thinks. Harry realizes the hardships facing him in his world, no longer relishing in the perfect, sought after life of a wizard, which is shown to Harry as being quite non-existent. Harry, as he transcends through his fifth year at Hogwarts begins to see how the Wizard World is not dissimilar to the World of Muggles. He sees this in the form of wizard prejudices and unfair treatment of those who aren't wizards. He also realizes the flaws in the Ministry of Magic. His once great inspiration, Dumbledore, falls if slightly down the ladder of Harry's respect. Also we see a more sinister side to Harry. He becomes rebellious and angry at times.

It's the summer, so Harry has been imprisoned with the Dursleys once more.  If there's one thing worse than the Dursleys, it's Harry's Aunt Madge.  It's not long before Aunt Madge is blown into a bigger balloon than Violet in Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.  Harry escapes, sure that the Ministry of Magic will be on to him in no time, and that he will be expelled from Hogwarts.  He's picked up by the Knight Bus, and deposited at the Leaky Cauldron, where Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, is waiting for him.  But instead of admonishing Harry, Fudge makes sure that he gets everything he needs, and waves his misdemeanours away.  This is the first sign Harry has that something is very wrong.  Still, the only obstacle Harry has to overcome is the biting book that Hagrid has sent him for his birthday.  It's not long before Harry's meeting Ron and Hermione in Diagon Alley.  Unfortunately, Hermione chooses to buy herself a cat as an early birthday present, and inevitably, Ron and Hermione bicker as the cat, Crookshanks, sets about hunting Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.  All Harry has eyes for is the Firebolt: the most sophisticated broomstick ever produced.  The Wealseys seem somewhat overprotective of Harry, and then Harry finds out why: Sirius Black is out to murder him.  Sirius Black is considered to be so dangerous that Fudge has even alerted the Muggle Prime Minister, and the Ministry of Magic has provided the Weasleys with a fleet of cars to transport them to King's Cross.  Sirius Black, Voldemort's faithful servant, killed thirteen people before he was apprehended, including one wizard...  Whilst on the Hogwarts Express, Harry and friends encounter the dishevelled Professor Lupin, their new teacher of Defence against the Dark Arts.  They also have a visitation from a Dementor, one of the sinister Azkaban guards (the wizard prison we learnt about in The Chamber of Secrets).  Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, which no one else has ever done before, so the fear is that he may well try to break into Hogwarts.  The Dementors, however, seem far more interested in Harry than looking for Black.  Harry fervently hopes that Gryffindor will win the Quidditch Cup, but then the Dementors attack him during a game.  Harry hears his mother's dying words in a dream, and believes he may have even seen his father...  But what is that mysterious dog that is stalking him?  Will he really die, as Professor Trelawney believes?  And why is Hermione appearing and disappearing, and acting so strangely?  Dumbledore's choice of teachers seems suspect when a Hippogriff attacks Malfoy in Hagrid's first lesson.  However, Harry seems to have found an ally against the Dementors in the form of Professor Lupin.  But the post of Defence against Dark Arts is not one to be taken lightly...  There are the usual encounters with the sinister Professor Snape, and we learn a bit more about his background (surely Alan Rickman's too old to play him?).  Rowling seems to have been delving into Thomas Bulfinch's The Age of Fable again, with her depiction of Salamanders as fire lovers.  Perhaps she's been also reading some Susan Cooper, as a Boggart makes a handy plot device.  The plot itself is as tight as usual, with the Prisoner of Azkaban being the most thrilling and disturbing in the series so far.",FALSE,2001,735
"5510",4,731240,FALSE,"Harry is back at Hogwart for the 5th year.  As far as I have read, Harry had landed himself in detention once more.  He is trying his best at school, trying to do all his assignments but his detention is in the way.  Not only is he not doing well in school, he have no time for Quidditch anymore.  Angelina Johnson the team captain of the Quidditch is on Harry's back about him missing practice.  Every time that he is in detention, she would hunt him down and yell at him for not showing up.  Even though Harry is very good at it, there is no way Professor Umbridge (the teacher that gave him detention) will let him off the hook.  Harry is very powerful, vengeance, a good friend, and a hard worker.  His friends (Hermione and Ron) are the only people who understand him after all that had happened for the past five years.  They have been with him through thick and thin.  Hermioine and Ron is the only family member that he has at school, so he tells them everything. I would recommend this book for my fellow classmates and friends because reading this book is like an escape from reality and magic helps that.  Magic is something that you don't see happened everyday.  Reading something that doesn't happen at all, help you get away from reality and make you stop thinking about all the bad stuff happening around the world.  The first time I'd read this book, the most magical thing that I have read was about Harry going to school on a train.  Reading that part of the scene makes me feel like I am one of the students waiting for the train to come; watching a brick wall, turned into a tunnel and a train comes out of no where.  Or reading about Harry being in detention and the lines he had to write.  Each time he wrote ""I must not tell lies""; a shape object cuts his hand and engraves ""I must not tell lies"".  Every detail that J.K Rowling wrote was very explicit.  It makes you see that what he wrote.  Like you are actually there watching it happen him.  The bad thing about the book is that there are a lot of made up words that she uses.  Like: quidditch, but after you read couple of sentences later you will see what the words means.  If you are into magic and spell, then Harry Potter books by J.K Rowling will be a great book for you to read.",FALSE,2003,1519

"5512",5,731169,FALSE,"Titlie: Harry Potter & The Prisoner of AzkabanAuthor: J. K. RowlingThe Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkabans, is about a man named Sirus Black,who was put in prison for killing thirteen people (one wizard). At night he would say things in his dreams, that a boy (Harry Potter) was at Hogwarts. That ws the same night he had escape for the must horrible prison a wizard can go to. He wsa also a close and loyal servant to a dark wizard named Lord Valmount. Lord Valmount was  a horrible wizard killed people if they wouldn't accept his offer to turn to the dark magic. So now Harry's third year at Hogwarts is being gruarded tight this year, but Harry is still not safe even at the walls of Hogwarts, and Hogwarts has the top best wizdards. The characters of the third book are Herimone Granger (friend), Ron Weasly (best friend), Dursely Family (aunt, uncle, and couison of Harry), Professor Snape (Harry's worst teacher), Hagrid (gatekeeper), Darco Malfoy (Harry's emeny), The Weasly's (Ron's family)ere are also two new teachers (you have to find them) in Harry's third year at Hogwarts.Harry Potter is the youngest seeker of a Hogwarts sport called ""Quidditch"". The game is a little like football on broomsticks, the object of the game is to get the playing materials through the hoops, and to have the most points before the match is over. You can also win the game by having the seeker (someone who's job is to caught a golden wing ball), caught the golden ball and end the game before the other team does.One of the raising events that happens in the book is Harry Potter has a match and something happen to him that could kill him, but something may happen to save him. The book has a lot of events that comes in every chapter, it keeps ayou wanting to read more and more. The characters around Harry plays a huge role in his life. Harry lost his parents to Lord Valdemont and he was the only oone one who survives his curse.The books has a lot of look very careful at the words, so that you can understand, and be able to solve clues that the book gives. It's one of the best science fiction books I have very read.

"5516",4,731193,FALSE,"I bought the Harry Potter Book 5 last Friday at midnight and finished reading it in 5 days.  Overall, I thought it was a good book(not excellent) and feel it is J.K. Rowling's 3rd best Harry Potter book to date.  My preferences goes as follows(least best to best): Book 2, Book 1, Book 5, Book 3, and Book 4. I think the story of Harry's fifth year is told in a similar template to her previous work(somewhat making the book redundant): Summer at Dursley's, 1 half of school year, christmas vacation, 2nd half of school year, climatic adventure and solution to major year long problem with review from Dumbledore, and returning back to Dursley's.  The major problem of Harry's fifth year is that Voldemort is back alive, but mainly staying in hiding organizing his group of supporters, trying to recruit more help(i.e. giants, dementors, more death-eaters), and trying to find information on why he got defeated previously(i.e. the prophecy).  His staying in hiding in turn causes many to choose between believing Harry and Dumbledore that Voldemort is really back or follow the more conservative view from The Ministry of Magic that since Voldemort and his followers haven't overtly surfaced that Voldemort cannot be back.  Many subplots and trials occur in Harry's fifth year that take up most of the initial 700 pages of book including being attacked by dementors and the trial that occurs following the encounter, Professor Umbridge being the new defense against the dark arts teacher then rising to power to eventually becoming head mistress of Hogwarts in doing so disrupting one after another of Hogwarts normality, new developing relationships between Hogwart students esp. Harry and Cho, and preparing for the O.W.L.S. The final 150 pages are the best part of the book where the real action takes place and we learn new information about Harry's past.  It also is where the Order of Phoenix and Dumbledore join in with Harry to thwart Voldemort and his death-eaters.  In the process, one member dies and Harry heads home for the summer at the Dursley's with this continually going through Harry's mind.  Overall, the fifth book is well-done, but suffers in being too long(mainly the 700 pages of introduction and minor subplots) and because all the Harry Potter books to date keep the same template making the originality of the fifth book seem repetitious.",FALSE,2003,1472
"5517",4,731202,FALSE,"I am not a rabid Harry Potter fan, but I really like all the books Rowling has written so far.  This installment is no exception.  Rowling retains her gift of humorous, flowing prose and her ability to evoke true emotions in readers.  I found myself getting so frustrated with Professor Umbridge (a new character who does everything she can to make Harry's life miserable) that I felt as if I myself was one of her students. This is why everyone loves Rowling.  Many argue that this is the darkest Potter novel, but I think much of that darkness would be better called complexity.  Nothing is black and white anymore: Harry has grown into a bitter and not always pleasant teenager, the ""good guys"" (Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic) are turning against eachother, and many more once-simplistic ideas readers had are turned on their heads.  Rowling has done a convincing job of portraying the characters actually growing up.  Truly this is a coming of age story more than any previous Harry novel.Nevertheless, ""Order"" has its flaws.  Like its predecessor, Book 4, this installment crams most of important action into the last 150 pages.  Don't get me wrong; the massive buildup is very entertaining, and the book does not drag at all.  But when things finally start to happen, it is a letdown.  The major betrayal, death, and revalation are all predictable.  Nothing that happened during or after the book's climax surprised me nearly as much as the little hints given during the slower buildup.  And even with all of that, a few things still felt unfinished or unecessary.""Order of the Phoenix"" is very enjoyable, extremely well-written, and sufficiently suspenseful, but it does not live up to high-water mark set by the third book, ""Prisoner of Azkaban.""  The first two books were a little more juvenile but satisfyingly concise, and the last two books were deeper but more anticlimactic.  Only the middle work, ""Azkaban,"" struck the perfect balance.  If Rowling can swing the pendulum back to that standard for the final two books, ""Harry Potter"" will surely earn its place as one of the greatest fantasy series of all time.",FALSE,2003,1481
"5518",5,731192,FALSE,"To start of this review, i would have to say that i had lost interest in Harry Potter. I had read the books many, many times and had noticed an extremely big downside to the book: it was all too convinent. for example: in the first book, J.K. had made it that in each of the rooms gaurding the sorcerors stone, there was a challenge testing the specific abilities of each of the three main characters. The first was a room with flying keys and it took Harry's expert flying skills on the broom to get past that obstacle. In the second room, is was Ron who was called upon to direct Harry and Ron in an expert life size chess match. In the third room, it was Hermione who came through using her imense intelect to figure out a near impossible riddle.In all of these cases, it tested their main ablities, which was a good cap for a 7 year old reader, but not for someone a little older.  This is just one of the things that made me bored of Harry. The fact that he was a dull, and overly talented character with no personality at all.As i went through the books it seemed like J.K. Rowling was finaly breaking the ice and put a bit of a differant look on harry in the 4th book.I came into the 5th book expecting the same thing as usual: Harry gets away from the dursleys mid summer, then goes to hogwartz. He is embarrassed for a while there, and baffeled by strange happenings, and then comes through with a brilliant stroke of luck to delay Voldemorts plans. I was still willing to read it, however.i feel ashamed of myself after reading the book. it seems like i was completely wrong, because this book was amazing in that, it showed harry with a personality, doing sometimes reckless things and a big temper. It was very refreshing for me to see harry had manny faults, and for once, seemed to flex his wizarding muscle by teaching abiut 25 students  Defence against Dark Arts Lessons, because the new teacher was encapable, and since voldemort was coming to power, Harry felt people needed to be prepared.The bottom line, is that if i didnt know better, i would have thought this was a differant, but better author, and i commend J.K. Rowling (although i dont think she really needs it)and hope that this book brings even more people into the harry potter world.",FALSE,2003,1471
"5519",4,731559,FALSE,"The Order of the Phoenix continues where the Goblet of Fire left off. The tone is once again darker, bordering on the horrific (eg. Harry's punishment of 'writing lines'). It is another excellent story: long, without the slow parts of the Goblet of Fire, but without that story's terrifying climax.Much of the book is Harry feeling frustrated by the willingness of people to close their eyes to the evidence of Voldemort's return. Instead Harry is branded as a publicity seeker and trouble maker. Although almost certainly not intended by J.K.

Even with all this, Harry still has to endure a venomous Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, a potential girlfriend, final exams, and the reoccurring dreams and visions that are connected to his greatest enemy.

"5521",3,731200,FALSE,"Book five, The Order of the Phoenix, is a very dark and tedious read (the real action doesn't start until the last 106 pages). At times I was disconcerted as to where Ms. Rowling was headed with her story; trying to distinguish between plot and ""filler"" (did we really need to descend through Sirrus Black's family tree? Pleez!).I would suggest to the readers of this book to review or re-read book four. It had been a year for me and I had trouble remembering characters.In this book Harry's personality takes a turn for the worse. At first I thought Harry might be suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome. However as the book arduously rambles on it becomes painfully obvious that he has made the transition from super hero to nothing more than a typical egocentric, self indulged, poor me, temper tantrum, teenager.  I was hoping Hermione would zap him with a ""Prozac spell"". Even the painting on Dumbledore's wall were growing tiresome of Harry; in the words of Phineas Nigellus; ""...he would much rather be tragically misunderstood, and wallow in self-pity...""I applaud Ms. Rowling in her increasingly complex choice of words, not only entertaining her young audience but also challenging them to expand their vocabulary. Ms. Rowling also writes outstandingly on the subject of the grieving process. She shows us Cho, as she deals with the loss of Cedric; and writes brilliantly as we see Harry's mind set, thought process, and questions about death, with the loss of his loved one.Hopefully books six and seven won't be so dark.",FALSE,2003,1479

I enjoyed book 5 so much that I plan on reading both books 4 and 5 again, at a more leisurely pace.Some people have said that Harry is harsh in this book and somewhat whiney but to me that was the most refreshing part of this book.  Harry reacts just like a normal teenage boy would act.  He had fits of narcissism, self-loathing, depression and the well known ""why me?"" syndrome that just about every teenage boy and girl goes through.  The characters in this book react the way normal people would, or normal witches and wizards would.

"5523",4,731196,FALSE,"First I should say anyone that enjoys a good read look into the Harry Potter books.. they are well written, highly entertaining and full of robust characters, unexpected plot twists, mystery, suspense and everything else that makes a book keep you turning pages into the wee hours of the morning.That being said I have to confess I am somewhat dissapointed in this 5th instalment of the series. Or rather I should say the last 75 or so pages to be more accurate.The book imo has a rushed, hastily finished feel to the climax and is not at all up to par with the brilliant and imaginative writing I have come to love and expect from J.K. Rowling.The plot was outstanding.. the mystery and suspense kept me glued to the pages. The villians were masterfully done and a number of times I was shaking with rage and frustration over the antics of Umbridge and Fudge, then dancing with glee when some event would trasnpire to knock them down a rung or two.Everything seemed to be moving along fantasticlly.. then once you get into the final chapters and the climax starts to unfold it just kinda falls flat..I dont know.. it all felt wrong to me. Over the course of any series you get to know the characters.. what they are like, how they behave ect ect.. I could not escape the feeling that all the characters I had grown to know over the course of 4 novels and 90% of the 5th were suddenly behaving in ways you know they wouldn't.The hardest part of writing fantasy is setting fantistic elements into a cohesive and believeable world. The most important job of the writer when weaving these fantastic elements into a story is to do it in such a manner as to suspend our disbelief, to make the impossible seem possible.This book just did not do that for me as strongly as the preveious 4 had done.I felt let down and somewhat cheated at the end. It felt as if she had written the book with a fantastic story in mind but no clear idea on how to close it, and when she reached the point where it was nessaccary to do so she just sorta winged it.This is just my opinion of course but I have to say what was shaping up be THE best instalment in the series to date suddenly fell apart and fell far short of hitting the mark.",FALSE,2003,1475
"5524",5,731191,FALSE,"~The first thing you have to know is Order of the Phoenix is very different from the other four books in the Harry Potter series. It's more focused on character development and cannot be considered a ""stand-alone"" type of book; it is more of a (magnificent) transition between Goblet of Fire and book 6. In Goblet of Fire, readers see a relatively safe and just wizarding world start to break apart, so it is fit for Order of the Phoenix to further the depiction of the deteriorization of the~~ magical community. Harry is angrier (justifiably so) and the now chaotic wizarding world is struggling with the rise of Lord He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named again. A few beloved (and not so beloved) old characters return, while fascinating new places are introduced and explored. Rowling describes new locations with her utmost care and to such perfection that you'd deeply regret being a muggle and wish you could do a little apparating yourself. Though the book is focused on many darker subjects such as~~ death and sacrifice, humor is not lost. The Weasley twins offer their usual comic relief beautifully. Along with Harry's new bitter attitude comes a rather sharp-witted tongue and even the usually strict Professor McGonagall offers some of her snappy wisdom. Events happen in rapid succession and it may take several readings to catch all the hidden trinkets Rowling slips into her tale. A few situations in the story seemed pointless (think Hagrid...) but they will undoubtedly prove to be crucial~~ in the next two books. Some of the long-waited revelations weren't delivered and it felt that the story ended up posing more questions than answering, which only builds up the anticipation. Balancing out these slight disappointments are the characters, who keep growing in both quality and quantity. Who can resist the odd little Luna Lovegood or the ... interesting new Professor Dolores Umbridge? Ginny learns to form coherent sentences, Harry learns about girls and everyone learns of the tragic~~ death of one important character.The ride is bumpy, there is quite a bit of yelling and of course large doses of magic.

"5525",3,731207,FALSE,"This book pretty much proves a tendency that I have noticed ever since book 3.Harry is becoming more and more selfish and arrogant.He seems to think that the whole world only evolves around him which,at times,makes him a character that is not very likeable (not to mention that he treats his two only friends like dirt in this book)Also the book just seems to be dragging on and on.The book has a good pace,until Harry gets back to Hogwarts and then the whole narrative just falls right back in to the dull 'from classroom to classroom' daily life of the Hogwarts students.Don't get me wrong,this wouldn't be nearly as boring if it hadn't already been done in 4 previous books...My final and biggest point of criticism is that JK Rowling seems to have a preset pattern which she applies to all her books,which has become all too obvious.1.Harry stays at the Dursley's and doesn't like it2.Harry leaves the Dursleys and goes some place else for the rest of the summer (The Burrough,Diagon Alley,Quidditch Tournament,House of the Order of the Phoenix)3.Harry gets back to Hogwarts and we follow his day to day life at school.4.Some event or mistery comes up,attracting Harry's attention (cursed students,Sirius Black on the loose,Wizard Tournament etc.)5.Harry solves the mistery or event (usually with someone elses help) and leaves Hogwarts to go back to point #1.This system of storytelling is becoming highly repetative and I think most readers would appreciate it if JK Rowling would throw in a book with a completely new structure to suprise the readers...not to mention that all the Voldemort is back (again!) stories are slowlyg wearing out...I think that is another reason book 3 is my favorite...because it is the only one that is not about Harry fighting Voldemort.Despite all this criticism Order of the Phoenix is still a good book,which is fun to read and enjoyable,regardless of your age.My favorite thing about the book is the character of Luna Lovegood,who is very interesting and reminds me alot of one of my friends :)",FALSE,2003,1486

I hardly noticed the length; like the fourth book, you will get too involved to notice until you are on the last page and can't believe you'll have to wait another couple of years for more.--Obviously, the story is getting darker. The imagagery and characterizations are becoming deeper and darker. Everything that is going on, by nature, is dark. A common complaint I have ran into is that the book is too dark and getting too ""graphic"". To have presented it with a nice or bright tone would have been out of place. The idea of a dark lord, known for his killings and evil, is anything but happy or light hearted.--All the characters, new and old, have personalities built up in such a way that you can't help from liking or hating them. You will really feel for Sirius and his situation, while at the same time really come to hate Ms. Umbridge with a passion. Personally, I found myself thinking of the character in a ""real"" tense; I would be connecting to them more and more with each page I read.--My only complaint, which you will notice when you read the book, is Harry's personality. Yes, he is reacting pretty realistically to everything, but maybe too much so. I found it hard to relate to a character that was constantly being beligerant and in a long and drawn out bad mood. Maybe if the harshness in the things he said had been lightened up a little, he would have been more likeable.--I would say this book is appropiate for 8 and up.

Not for her ability to masterfully keep those of us reading on the tips of our toes or the edge of our seats, simultaneously reading as fervently as possible while trying to pace, for once the book is done, we know not when we will get another.  No, Ms. Rowling is brilliant because she is consistently one step ahead of the reader.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix starts out simply enough, as all have, with Harry avoiding his torturous family on Privet Drive.  We are soon, however, shown exactly what type of year he is in for at Hogwarts when he meets some unexpected foes mid-summer.From that moment on, we are taken along for the most difficult ride of Harry's life yet.  We watch him face obstacle after obstacle without his usual supporter.  We find him feeling trapped within the walls of Hogwarts, his usual sanctuary, seeking freedom from what becomes an all too frustrating year of events.  We find him taking on an unexpected responsibility at the urging of his confidants; one which, in no uncertain terms, is responsible for keeping him alive as this great chronicle ends.Far more fulfilling, however, is when we finally learn just what it is that brought Harry Potter to where he is today - we learn the answer to the only question Albus Dumbledore has failed to answer for Harry in four long years.  We are finally shown why it was, on that fateful night in July some 15 years ago, that Lord Voldemort attempted to kill Harry in the first place.  And, while this bit of information certainly makes things fall into place, it also leaves many unanswered questions, to which we know not how long we need wait to find answers.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a must-read.

"5529",5,731189,FALSE,"The fifth installment of the beloved Harry Potter series is upon us, and the question arises: was it worth the wait? It was.JK Rowling has once more proven that she can weave a tale without wearing out the wonders of the fantastic Wizarding World that her imagination has created. Although the old notables are still around-Dumbledore, Quidditch, dementors-there are new additions that serve to renew our interest and pique our curiosity. Harry has evolved into a full-blown adolescent with adolescent rage, insecurities, and angst, and the story has evolved into a darker, deeper tale with some subplots dealing with politics and the media.Just for Harry's evolution, from awe-filled, oppressed ten-year-old to angst-filled, confused teenager, I greatly enjoyed reading this book. Much as Rowling has managed to capture the intensity of Harry's uncertainty and wonder at actually being a wizard in the first few books, she has also managed to capture Harry's uncertainty in his feelings for his role models-his father, Dumbledore and Sirius Black, and in his relationship with the fairer sex. Furthermore, the other characters have also grown, and their own adventures make good reading in the subplots. Ron and Hermione are constantly bickering, Fred and George take their stunts up a notch, and Ginny Weasley is actually dating.She has also managed to simplify the trappings and maneuverings of politics into a more understandable prose, blurring the delineation between good and evil that was clear in previous books (Harry and Hogwarts good, Voldemort bad). Aside from Voldemort and his Death Eaters, there are now other villains that aim to make Harry's life more miserable. However, there are also new allies that guarantee that Harry is not alone in facing He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named: the so-called Order of the Phoenix, a motley collection of new and old friends.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a delectable treat that tackles may not end as upbeat as the first few books, but have progressed as our hero has progressed, from childhood into turbulent adolescence. It is the same Harry Potter that we have loved, but older, deeper, more thoughtful and with more adventure. A great read.",FALSE,2003,1468
"5531",5,731184,FALSE,"When I finished the 4th installment in the series I, like the rest of you out there, felt very expectant and anxious for the next.  The last chapters of GOF left Harry with quite a weight on his shoulders; he had just battled Voldemort in what was by far the most gruesome and challenging battle he had to face yet, he witnessed the death of his friend and also had to face the questioning and ever-fascinated attitudes of all of his Hogwarts peers when Dumbledore revealed the return of Voldemort (this made doubly difficult in the aftermath of Skeeter's horrible caricatures of him. . .).  Finally, Harry had to leave Hogwarts with the knowledge that his enemy and killer of his parents was back on the loose coupled with the fact that Fudge simply didn't believe a word of it.  Basically, Harry had alot on his shoulders.The thing I feared as I opened the cover of book 5 was that Rowling was going to bring us back into Harry's world with a light air, simply disregarding all of the highly traumatic events that ended book 4 (Harry might be extraordinary, even in the wizarding world, but no one can simply rebound from those types of events).  I feel very guilty for doubting her - I should have realized that she was better than that.  I have read some reader reviews that criticize Harry's moodiness and snippiness and the dark feel of book 5 but I have to say that I expected no less.  Rowling out does herself in this latest HP installment for while she shows us once again that she can write a wonderful, magical story she also reveals her truly insightful knowledge of human emotion, understanding and, well, psychology in her portrayal of the state of Harry following book 4.  Her ability to keep her fantastical, other-worldly characters REAL is what makes her stories truely superb.Rowling is a master storyteller and does not disappoint with this newest gem.",FALSE,2003,1463
"5532",2,731204,FALSE,"The fifth book of the popular Harry Potter series coasts along, with no apparent sense of who its audience is or how to keep the action going other than by a new death.  By the time the death of a fairly important character comes, it's very difficult to care.  The first half of the book is a big yawn, with many repetitious scenes involving Harry repeating his mantra of no-one-understands-me-and-all-I've-been-through.  Those speeches -- too many of which are shouted in capital letters -- include a laundry list of what occurred in the first four books.  One such recitation would have been sufficient for those foolish enough to try to step into the Hogwarts world in mid-series.  But after the third or fourth time, it is beyond tedious.Harry does so much sulking and self-pitying throughout the book that it is really hard to care about him.  Take for example the 850 or so pages of anger at Dumbledore -- for what?  We read over and over again that Harry is angry, but there is no real explanation, other than that he seems to resent Dumbledore trying to protect him.  He is angry that people expect anything of him, and he is angry when they don't trust him to take on Voldemort single-handedly.  I suppose the point was supposed to be that Harry is going through adolescence and all the annoying behavior and mood swings that involves.  But could that not have been portrayed in, at least, an interesting way?The book finally picks up about mid-way through, but it never builds to anything like real suspense, and the showdown at the end (nice of Voldemort to always wait to do his mischief until the end of the school year!) is not worth the build-up.Parents should be aware that there are some scenes that are inappropriate for children -- perhaps especially adolescents -- as they involve what can only be called torture and may appeal to the fascination some kids have with self-mutilation.  Unfortunately, those are among the scenes that are repeated ad nauseum.In the end, the best that can be said is ""Thank Merlin for Fred and George!""",FALSE,2003,1483

From the day I read the first Harry Potter book just to discover what all the fuss was about I've eagerly delved into Rowlings magical world and been carried away like millions of other adults and children.  Rowling pulls me in with Harry and his friends, experiencing and feeling the passion, excitement, thrill, and danger of an imaginary world that in spite of the fantasy manages to feel so very real.  This latest installment in the narrative of Harry's adventures lives up to our expectations.In Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts we find him questioning the basics of what he believes, angry at his lack of knowledge or control, and rebelling against a system which seems to oppress and manipulate.  We truly feel compelled by his adolescent angst and his struggles as he comes of age in a dark, uncertain world.  Rowling aptly portrays his journey through first love, jealousy, anger, and grief at the death of someone very dear to him.  Yes, keep ahold of your box of kleenex for this one, Harry-lovers out there.  The world and power of the evil Lord Voldemort have very real consequences in Rowling's fantasy world, and dear characters we love are no longer safe.We receive greater insight into the why of Harry's parents' death, the motivations of the darkly love/hateable Snape, and we have another Defense against the Dark Arts professor to despise.  (Get ready, this one's marvelously hideous).  Rowling pulls off this character, and many others with style.  Through it all, Rowling manages to touch on some serious and thought-provoking themes.  Racism, prejudice, slavery, political corruption, and friendship to name a few.  She even manages to weave in her old, delightful humor amidst the dark tones of her emerging story.All told, the book is right up there with Rowling's other novels; a gift to the reader.  The book is beautiful, enjoyable, and profound.  Readers everywhere will read, and reread this delightful piece of the Harry Potter story.

"5536",5,731189,FALSE,"Let me fist get straight to the point. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a very highly entertaining (but not entirely), darker, thought provoking, humorous (especially the weaslies), enjoyable, disturbing (in a good way), and a very scary book.My first impression of the book is how good the introduction was. This is by far the best introduction yet in any H.P. book. Let me put is this way. When you first read it, you will straight away jump into the 1st climax of the story. There will be lots of  chaos and pandemonium and you have no idea whats going on and  then straight away the unexpected hit you. Very cool and it really took my breath away. But after the intro (when they returned to Hogwarts) the story settles down and it starts to give many pieces of puzzles to you (it gets quiet boring at this point) and then it kicks off again in the last quarter of the book, (Many really cool stuff actually happens at the end of the book).There were some speculations about many things about the Order of the Phoenix (It was the 'old crowd'), Mrs Figg, the next DADA teacher, Snape, Lily, James, Lupin etc and expect many of them to be not true; and expect a LOT of twists in this book.Bear in mind that there is no big event like the triwizard tourn. happening (except for the OWL) thus that is why in the middle of the book there won't be alot of actions.What can you expect in this book?1. Alot of shouting from Harry (he is in a bad mood all the time!)2. A lot of twists about James, Snape, lily and Sirius3. A darker storyline.4. Many things will be unfold.5. Deaths. (many of them)What can I say? The 5th book of Harry Potter did indeed meet my high expectations of the Harry Potter's saga. But, having said that  there is still some minute flaws in this 5th instalment (I felt guilty of saying that) and deserves a 4.9/5. HP&TOTP is only and introduction to the big battle.

Not to my surprise, J.K. Rowling had yet again laid her charming grasp upon me. Harry's fifth year, though darker and more morbid than any prior book, was by far the most entertaining read.At certain points I found I was forcing myself to stop reading so I could savor the book; often times even rereading chapters to find them more entertaining that time through. J.K.'s writing matured along with Harry in this book; her use of foreshadowing and stunning attention to detail truly enhanced this novel.The book itself introduces new (previously unexplored) themes such as romance, anger, and tormenting pain.Harry himself deals with a hefty dose of frustration in this novel. As anyone familiar with the series knows Harry hasn't had an easy life by any standards. The Order of the Phoenix certainly doesn't allow Harry to escape the struggle-triumph cycle he seems to be stuck in. Between the battles with the Ministry of Magic, Lord Voldemort himself, Death Eaters, and some magical creatures Harry finds himself facing his most difficult year yet. Not to mention the most taxing challenge of coping with the death of a loved one arises. On top of this seemingly unbearable load, Harry struggles with the basic problems involved with young relationships.This novel's excitement value exceeds all of it's predcessors as well. The introduction of new enemies, new magical creatures, and a look at the Wizarding world's government/politics provides a new attraction to the Potter series. The Order of the Phoenix itself is undoubtedly the greatest addition to the world of Harry Potter. Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix give vital roles to otherwise unimportant characters.J.K. Rowling continues to appease the constantly growing appetites of Harry Potter fans.

It takes the reader deeper and deeper into Harry's emotions, life, and heart.J.K. gives us a character that we can all relate to. She connects the readers to Harry through his awkward approach to the opposite sex *cough* Cho Chang, studying for the highly stressful O.W.L.s, and his devastating new wave of grief. We sympathize with Harry's frustrations when he frequently blows up at Ron and Hermione because they simply ""don't understand.""  He also copes with the ""slight problem"" of more than half the Wizarding World, including his fellow classmates, refusing to accept that Lord Voldemort has returned to power, and having them believe that Harry is an attention-seeking ""git."" Then, of course, there is the matter of a recurring dream Harry has of attempting to open a black door in a circular room, which he is sure he has seen before... but where? All this occurs while Harry tries to bear the intensifying pain from his scar and the hostility of an extremely irrational new teacher. Don't worry though, it's not all depressing. You can always count on Fred and George Weasly to lighten up the mood with their outlandish pranks that amuse and delight their fellow Hogwarts' students as well as the readers.Rowling seamlessly weaves mystery with tears, adventure, heroism, and the trials of growing-up to create the beautiful soul of The Order of the Pheonix. It leaves the reader satisfied and awed at the unraveling of her masterpiece. Questions are finally answered and Harry learns the true reason of Voldemort's pursuit of him since his birth.  J.K. Rowling's brilliant novel leaves the reader wishing to return to Hogwarts just as much as Harry does... anxiously awaiting the next installments.

"5539",5,731193,FALSE,"This latest installment in the Harry Potter series was both exhilarating and heart breaking.  It is quite a different read from the earlier books, especially the first two, where Harry is too young to really understand all that is going on around him.  This book sees him through the first year when he is a young man, and no longer a boy.  It is dark, it is sad, but it is also hopeful.Harry learns the secrets of why Lord Voldemort tried to kill him 15 years ago, and he has to yet again face him and the Death Eaters, who are continuously trying to kill him and his loved ones.  The hurt and pain that Harry experiences throughout the book is so well written that you feel like you are living it with him.  You also experience his confusion and frustration that comes with being a young man, including his first date with Cho.Harry has a new nemesis in this book, along with Voldemort, and that is Dolores Umbridge.  She gave me the feeling of being almost as evil as Voldemort, but in an entirely different way.  She suffocates any happiness and works hard at forbidding the students of Hogwarts from actually learning anything that may aid in their fights against Dark Wizards and especially Voldemort.  Harry rises against this, getting himself in more trouble then he's ever been in, and forms a secret club, to teach other students whom he trusts real defense against the Dark Arts skills.In the end, all of the nasty rumors about Harry and Dumbledore are extinguished, and their names are once again redeemed in the public eye. But along with this comes great cost and unhappiness, because the steps Harry takes to fight against Voldemort takes from him someone he truly loves.It's a very fast and well thought out read, though it has left me feeling sad.  But I also feel that now, perhaps, Harry can truly start being the Wizard he is meant to be, and realizing his goals and dreams, now that he knows the truth behind Voldemort's attacks on him.I of course recommend any lover of Harry Potter books to read this book.

"5540",5,731187,FALSE,"I read this book in three days, and I was enthralled by it. It was different for the other four and that is what made it special. There was no James Bond, Scooby Doo unmasking at the end which was the suprise. Since Voldemort is back there can not be another great villian for Harry to beat. Umbridge is a damn fine person to hate but she was exactly who she appeared to be. One of the things that I disliked in the first four books was that the villian reveals everything and by doing so, gives Harry a chance to escape.My previous favorite book was the Prisoner of Azkaban because we learn the most in that one, and it deviated by the formula set in the first two books.The fourth book was the dramatic ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the series. The Order of the Pheonix is the transition book between Goblet of Fire and the last two, and it did it very well. This book builds up suspense for the remaining two books of the series.Some people are saying that the book is too long, boring, too dark, etc. I disagree with these people for the following reasons:1. If there was another great big adventure where Harry and company save the day (again) it would be too repetitve.2. The begining of the fifth book was, to some, slow, but I thought that this built up interest. I thought that the beginning of the fourth book was much more boring.3. TOO DARK??????? Of course it is dark. NEWS FLASH: VOLDEMORT IS BACK. It has to be dark.4. Others say that Harry is too angry. While reading the book I was rooting Harry on. I think he has been too nice for too long. Let's see what Harry has to be angry about: Parents murdered, abusive family, everyone thinks he is crazy, UMBRIDGE, Snape, Dumbledore ignoring him, seeing Cedric die, seeing Voldemort rising, his scar burning, dementors after him, MALFOY.... Oh maybe it has to do with Voldemort and his followers trying to kill him.The book shows that all characters are flawed, even Dumbledore.

Once again, as in many series of books bydifferent authors, as the main character grows older, you yourself must be older to fully understand the book, especially since the love interest will mean little to a reader aged 9 who has never had a girlfriend or boyfriend. The language used is more advanced than ever meaning that younger readers may struggle, and the increased levels of violence and death, while written of in a very lighthearted way, are slightly more disturbing than anything in the first 3 books, continuing the lines of the latter quarter of the 4th book.I believe Joanne Rowling has finally come to realise that in England, her own country, her adult readers are more common than her child readers, and as a result she is writing to aim more at these older readers - afterall, parents must buy the book for their child, so will inevitably end up reading it themselves, either to their child, or themself.Whatever the reasons, this book is even more gripping than the first 4 - the development of characters has reached a peak until we can fully understand the emotions and aims of the characters - whatever else can be said about the book, this is a wonderful book.",FALSE,2003,1467

However, as I read it, I was thinking at the same time that 5 year olds could be listening to this story too. The 5th book is much scarier and has some 'interesting' jokes in it. And, seeing that the 2nd book had been scary too, I wondered if this one might have been ok. However, this one is still a little over with the scary things. And, the length of it and the style in which Rowling wrote, it has evolved too. The style has become more sophisticated and the length much longer to take in more details. No longer is this a little kid's book, but it seems to aim towards slightly older readers. Maybe Rowling feels that it's a need since the kids who were first reading at 10 are 15 now. I don't know whether it is a good thing in the way her books evolved because certainly now, the kids starting to read will not age 5+ years before they get to the 5th book.On the other hand, I thought that reading the 5th book was a joy, though I am controversial about it being a fav out of the 5. I give it 5 stars because I love Harry Potter books and reading it was fun, despite so many things beeing unrealistic, and I'm not talking about the magic part. The way Harry reacted to Cho's emotions was a little weird and insensitive. But then again, a couple characters seemed insensitive in several places.  Also, the fight, how did Harry, Neville, and all those friends become so good at fighting? Yeah yeah yeah, the D.A. lessons, but against full grown experienced wizards?There were some very interesting characters and I love Lupin, Moody, and Tonks - well, the Order members overall. Mundungus was fun too. Fred and George are smart as ever and I wonder what's going to happen without them in the next 2 books. I am glad that Ron finally gets the chance to be something that he always wanted to be.Back to mixed reactions, the lack of Quidditch and Halloween and stuff seems to be paving way for other details, but I feel that maybe its a mistake to take out some lightheartedness.

This darker, more sinister, and also more exciting sequel to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is, in my opinion, tied for the best one yet (with, of course, number one).Harry's angry feelings and noticeable shift of outlook-from that of a child to that of an adult-is probably the reason why the book is so readable and enjoyable. Just like the whimsical quality to the first three or four made them so popular, Rowling's darker theme is sure to keep the world reading until the very final installment.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix explains quite a bit of the wizarding world. We find out why Lord Voldemort tried to kill Harry as an infant, and also we enter many new important areas, like the Ministry of Magic, the headquarters for Voldemort resistance, and even St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The Order of the Phoenix, this organization, is a revival of the group of the same name which battled the Dark Lord fifteen years before. We also see the extraordinary corruptness of the wizarding world like we've never seen it before, which only makes Harry's quest for vengeance against his parents' murderer only harder.The addition of many new characters, like the evil (and positively infuriating to any reader) Dolores Jane Umbridge, to the REAL Alastor Moody make the fifth Harry Potter fresh and thrilling. Also, the elaboration and development of many old characters also improve the storyline. For example, the previously pretty-face-and-that's-about-it Cho Chang now is established as a thoroughly annoying girl (she truly is something that Amazon.com would get angry at me for saying).This 870-page edge-of-your-seat package of fury, magic, alliances is one that all ages will love. Readers will be literally putting their hands over the next page of text, so as not to spoil the suspense so abundant in this well-written book.

My only other criticism ties in with that, in that both the Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix had a distinct ""serial"" flavor about them. I had no sense of coming to the end of a book, just the frustration of having the story cut off in the middle on a couple of cliffhangers. Harry's characterization in this book is a lot less sweet and occasionally disturbing, which is only proper as he is 15 going on 16 throughout the book. The introduction of burgeoning love interests in the book is very charming and well done.

When it comes down to it, the majority of readers are people older than the advised ages.2. ""The book's long and tedious."" It's 870 pages, and the plot is very thick, with many subplots and characters to keep track of. Some may find it ""boring,"" while others will wonder what it's leading up to. Truth is, Order of the Phoenix is more of a psychological novel than a children's thriller/mystery; it ventures into the psyche of a teenaged mind wrought with responsibility and problems that are sometimes of a life-or-death matter.3. ""The writing is anything but commendable. It's full of cliches, it's predictable, and each book is the same thing over and over again anyway."" While many would like to think this is true (and it is as far as organization of the story goes), each book builds up on the last, and from the larger perspective there's an underlying story. Try reading Prisoner of Azkaban without reading the first two. It's possible, but highly unlikely you'll truly understand what's going on. The plot, the names, the events are full of ties to mythology and other great works of literature (intentionally so), and Rowling manages to make her novels two-sided: one for the casual reader and another for the sharp-eyed one (who inevitably will get more out of them).

After the first few chapters, though, I was hooked, much to my chagrin.  Rather than running out of steam, Rowling is hitting her stride.  Although the book is perhaps a bit too long, Rowling wisely uses the pages to develop characters that we already know, rounding them out into people, not just stereotypes.  Some have, and will continue to complain that this new installment does not advance the plot of the series enough, but I think it's about time we stopped moving at breakneck speed through Harry's life and took some time to look around and get acquainted with his world and the people in it.",FALSE,2003,1484

A fine example of ""falling apart"" is the mere fact that Professor Snape is relatively NICE in this book! it's completely uncharacteristic and off-putting. Either way it's a cracking good read, i bought it at the midnight release party and i didn't put it down all night (why should sleep stand in my way?) so i finished it the day it came out! i was a little bit disappointed that not all questions were answered (hard to explain, you'd understand once you read it) and by the fact that the questions that WERE answered were somewhat unsatisfactory. perhaps because now there's no mystery left. although it is a great book i do not plan to read it a third time because i already know what happens. usually i can read books over and over but i can't with this one. it was emotionally taxing the first time, but now i find that i just would rather wait for the sixth book.",FALSE,2003,1459

Rowling continues to supply the reader (kid or adult) with excitement, humor and action in the fifth book in the HP series. Harry Potter, now 15 years old, is once again thrust into the middle of torment and intrigue as the leaders of the wizard world refuse to believe the evil dark lord Voldemort is back and rebuilding his legion of evil followers. Harry's age and past are taking its toll, with the character growing angry and quick to temper as he returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is faced with Headmaster Dumbledore growing distant, an on again/off again girlfriend, a new hostile teacher imposed by the government, and a recurring dream about a mysterious doorway.

Not to mention, the hormones kick up a notch, and some genuinley funny moments keep the heroes' heads relatively straight.At times it seems Harry has had all he can stand, finally questioning the acts and thoughts of those around him as his time at Hogwarts heads into the final stretch, and he wonders what this world actually has in store for him. He's right to question, but even better, he also listens to their replies. Those he cares for deepest don't fail him, and he stands up for them yet again as well.

It was especially hard to put down toward the last 100 pages of the novel.Fascinating new people appear in Book 5, such as Tonks, the accident-prone Auror, and Professor Umbridge, the horrible new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher. Old characters are also given more depth. Long-unsolved mysteries are explained. An ominous last chapter more than hints about what the sixth novel will be about. Rowling has a lot of room to do all this in the 850+ pages of the novel - but as I love her descriptions of the wizarding world, I'm not complaining about the book's sometimes crawling pace.Harry is finally a teenager in this book; or rather, he finally begins to act like one. It's nice that J.K. Rowling is letting Harry age with the series instead of keeping him a child forever, as is the case with so many children's series. However, though I am a teenager myself, it became hard to relate to Harry's angst as he constantly seethed with ""white hot anger"" and boiled with frustration. He loses his temper with everyone - Snape, Umbridge, and especially his friends - about once every twenty pages. Near the end of the novel he even begins shouting at Dumbledore, ""YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL!"" Harry comes across as irritating rather than suffering at that point.The rumors that there would be a death of a key character in Book 5 are true - but the death, which occurs at the climax of the novel, is depressing and bewildering. It seems as though Rowling included it merely to keep the novel from becoming a sappy ""happily ever after"" story. While I would hate for that to happen, I reached the end of Order of the Phoenix feeling kind of empty inside.Of course I'll read the next two installments of Harry's life - what Harry Potter fan couldn't?

For one, many teasers for the book have hinted at a death.  I expected to be bawling about this event for hours.  I will not give anything away, but I personally had not made any special connection to this particular character.  Others may have, so this may not be a point of disappointment for all readers.  I was also expecting much more death in the book than actually happened, though I am sure there is more to come.  I am also finding the J.K. Rowling is taking longer and longer to get to the point.  Given the main points of action and details included, the book could have been a lot shorter.  This could easily be compared to ""The Stand"" by Stephen King.  The characters take a long and mainly uneventful journey then something huge happens at the end.  There are a few major things that happen plus the end, but to me it felt like the book was an endless ""Day in the Life.""  However, this book was not all bad.  The story was VERY well told, and Rowling does an excellent job of bringing what seemed to be minor details from previous novels into the main storyline.  I had to make references back to previous novels!  She is also rounding out her characters.  At first I felt a hint that there may have been some influence from actors playing the characters in the movies, but I began to realize that we are just seeing them develop further.  We are beginning to see sides of characters that we have never seen - or expected to see - before.  I think that one of the reasons I have found the book ""slightly"" disappointing is because it is hard to remember there is still more to come in this saga.  thsi is not a bad thing.

In this book there will be characters you will absoloutly HATE but maybe that's because in my opinion the character development is much better than the other books. There were twists and turns that were unexpected and left you on the edge of your... couch, or whatever you sit on when you read.

Yes, it makes him a more realistic adolescent, but I get to deal with plenty of those in the real world.

The Slytherin's team has been unbeaten for  a long time.  This time (I am glad to say) Harry and Ron did  not miss the train as they did in the second book in the series. In the  train Harry found a cabin for Ron, Hermione, and Harry to talk, but the  only problem was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts  teacher was  sleeping in there. They figured since he was sleeping and it was the only  cabin left he would not mind. After Harry told them about Sirius Black, the  train stopped. Harry thought it was to early for them to be at Hogwarts. It  was the dementors; they were boarding the train. The dementors are guards  from Azkaban. The reason they were boarding was because they were going to  guard Hogwarts.  Since it was Harry's 3rd year he could go to  Hogsmeade. Hogsmeade it like a wizard mall. It has shops for everything.

The middle part of the book, when they were in Hogwarts, I thought, was a lot about character development. Throughout, we get to see the characters emerging and growing and lets the reader know what kind of person they are. Harry, as a 15 year old, starting to develop a temper over things that are unsatisfying to him. But, it fits exactly what a 15 year old would do. He also begins to have an interest in girls and the whole bit with him and Cho Chang are kind of fun to read, but do get tedious after a while. The other characters, Ron and Hermione, we can see, have also developed and are given significant roles in the story. I don't have much complains about it except for the lack of plot in the middle, but the story picked up the pace in the end and the last 100 pages are action packed!!!

Yet, out of a clear blue sky, Harry states that he will never forgive Snape.  It really isn't clear what Snape did that needs forgiveness.

This death is indeed one of Harry's biggest fans, as JKR had hinted, though it is not one of his peers, as you might expect.  I was surprised, I'll give you that much.  Harry also branches out a bit and widens his circle of freinds to include more than just Ron and Hermione.  Neville, in particular, becomes much more of a significant character.  We learn a huge secret about Neville too, tied in with the mystery as to why Voldemort tried to kill Harry in the first place.

In her other books, JKR didnt explain her little clues much to the reader, you often had to come to the answer on your own.  In the Order of the Phoenix, however, she spends more time elaborating on the little hints she throws out there, leaving less to the imagination.

I didn't cry though when he fell through the veil because it was just weird.There is humor on every page of this book that gives it's depressing mood an up lift, and it's a perfect example of J.K. Rowling's sophistication.  This book has action, comedy, emotion, horror, suspense, angst, and fantasy so I think it would be a perfect read for everyone.This book could be shortened, as we could lose about fifty pages by cutting out the adverbs and some unnecessry subplots.  even though it's longer than Goblet of Fire, it seems to go faster which is because of the improved pacing.I highly recommend you read this book once a year, because after five or so reads the spine bends and the book falls apart.

On the other hand, it is a compelling story.  Rowling explores several aspects of Harry and the adults in his life that could have made several books.  These characteristics show just how much everyone is neither all good, nor all bad -- even the Dursleys.  Okay, the Malfoys and Valdemort are still pretty much in the all bad column.  And one knows that the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher wasn't going into the good column.  Harry's confusion over girls and Hermione's guide to what other people are thinking are also quite well done.  It is almost as if J.K.

Harry faces a variety of disappointments in his fifth year, but finds one thing he is particularly good at, which is pretty typical for the age.  With all the emphasis on the tests, Rowling leaves it to the sixth book to find out how Harry does on his O.W.Ls.  I'm not sure that children in the U.S. will understand just how these tests will impact Harry, in that the U.S. system doesn't have school finishing exams such as the G.C.E.s -- the SAT doesn't count.

There's less humor and zaniness, as the problems at issue in the story world have gone beyond winning the Quiddich Cup to serious conficts between good and evil. We continue to discover more about characters we thought we knew, and they continue to become more human (so to speak) and well-rounded.I would think parents who aren't reading this series along with their kids (if there are any) should be advised that unlike the protagonists of some children's series, Harry is actually growing up. While I could imagine a seven or eight year old child reading the first three books, this book might be too much -- Harry is now a very believable 15-year-old, with all the problems that go along with that age. And the ""major death"" that Rowling said would happen in this book does occur. Overall, it's a darker book than books one through three, or even book four.I've heard some people voice concerns about the magic and fantasy elements of this story. I suppose that if you don't want your kids experiencing anything of the kind, this is not the book for you. However, it seems to me that the message of the series, which comes out more clearly in this book than in any other so far, is that our love for one another is the most worthwhile quality we have, and that it is what makes us strong. Readers will be glad to know that Harry is making that discovery in some of the darkest days he has faced yet.",FALSE,2003,1472

Immediately upon returning from Phoenix, the city, I picked up the longest member yet of the Harry Potter series and read the 870 paged novel for nearly 10 hours, stopping only to eat and sleep. It was just as, perhaps more, amazing as the first four in the series. I literally fell asleep with the book in my hands because I was unwilling to put it away and call it a night.The Order of the Phoenix is much darker than the other Harry Potter books. The true peril of Lord Voldemort is realized, and the second war against him begins in earnest. Another struggle must be waged against the Ministry of Magic, who refuse to believe Voldemort has returned, and Harry must endure having the reputation of a ""nutter"", courtesy of the Daily Prophet. Fudge has planted a spy at Hogwarts by the name of Dolores Umbridge, whose Defense Against Dark Arts classes are a snore, and are more useless, even, than Professor Lockhart's classes. Along with heavy class loads in preparation for O.W.L.s, a teacher who is determined to ""reform"" the school and block out any rumors of Voldemort's return, recurring dreams and scar aches, and the Dark Lord himself, Harry struggles with the basic complaints of an adolescent boy, like mood swings and trying to understand girls (Cho Chang in particular).The book comes to a final battle waged against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry, of course, survives, but one of his friends does not. While trying to deal with his grief, Harry learns more about the mystery surrounding the murders and attempted murder of his parents and him, and the new weapon the Dark Lord seeked and failed to take.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a very worthwhile read.

We are so interested in knowing what will happen next to Harry Potter and Voldemart and it was wonderful to finally have the next instalment.There are a lot of good things in the book. There are some new characters and a lot more about the existing ones. We learn something about Prof Snape, who is for me one of the most interesting characters in the series and still rather ambiguous. Harry has to deal with some uncomfortable new information about his parents. He finds himself in the awful position of being treated as a bit of a joke and a fraud, and it seems that Dumbledore is totally ignoring him. Dumbledore has his own problems, as the ministry and others believe him to be increasingly senile. There is some interesting stuff about the Black family and the world of the Pure-blood wizard aristocracy. The Weasley family esp. Mrs Weasley, Percy and the Weasley twins have important parts. Hermione keeps getting more brilliant and wise. There is a amusing encounter with Prof Gilderoy Lockhart. And more .....But I have some major problems with the book. First, considering that this is the longest of the books so far and took so long to write, nothing much really happens. At the end of the last book Lord Voldemart had returned to full command of his powers, but is strangely absent from this one. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" etc were shorter and had more plot. Secondly, the transition of Harry from cheerful nice-guy before the summer holidays to moody, bad-tempered adolescent when he comes back to school is just too sudden.""Order of the Phoenix"" is not as dark and atmospheric as ""Goblet of Fire"", which was almost too disturbing for my son. Not sure if it was intentional, but this book will not cause any nightmares.",FALSE,2003,1468

Gone is the small, always optimistic boy, and suddenly we are thrown a moody teen who takes out his frustrations on his friends, and a severe dislike for authority. Well, he's 15, hormones are kicking in. He lashes out, then realizes how horrible he's been. The life of a hormonal teenager. Rowling has aged him perfectly, and if nothing else, this book can be appreciated as a wonderful coming of age story.But it's so much more then that, too. The darkest of the 5 books leads us deeper into the battle against the wizarding world and the evil wrath of voldermort, who is back and badder then ever, even though the Ministry of Magic won't believe it, and paint harry and dumbledore in a rather unattractive light...corruption and hypocracy in government? It's something the adults will pick up on right away, but explained easily enough for the children to understand.There's a new fascist-like DADA teacher you'll love to hate, strange dreams, a prophecy, problems with girls (yes, you will see a lot more of Cho Chang), drastic changes in the Quidditch lineup, a meeting with James Potter and the others as they were at Harry's age (and he's not the person Harry thought James would be) and the stressful preparation for the O.W.L.'s. Rowling definetely hasn't lost her touch. There are little twists, big suprises, and little laughs that will make the 800-something page book a joy to read.note: Readers new to the series may need the backstories of the first 4 books for this one to make complete sense, but that time will be well invested.Get this book now!",FALSE,2003,1533
"5584",5,729751,FALSE,"You can identify with Harry Potter, an orphan raised by mean-spirited relatives.  In many ways, he is a very ordinary boy, with unruly hair, glasses, and a love of sport (Quiddich, that is). He isn't as good in  school (Hogwarts) as is Hermione Granger, one of his best friends, and he  likes to wander around having adventures (especially at night) rather than  doing his homework.  Despite his notariety, he quiet and unassuming. But  he's different in a way we all wish we could be:  He is a wizard of immense  and mysterious power.  In the Prisoner of Azkaban, as in the first two  books in the series, he confronts awsome forces of evil -- and  prevails.The details of the Wizard world are wonderful. There are  candies that magically take many different flavors (not all of them are  desirable), owls that deliver letters (including ""howlers"" that  noisily scold the recipient), a magic bus that causes houses and trees to  jump out of its way, and portraits that look and talk as though they were  alive.And the characters are wonderful, too.  One of Harry's best  friends is Ron Weasly, who comes from a big poor family, all of whom have  flaming red hair and get lumpy sweaters from their mother for Christmas.  The teasing that goes on among the Weasly children -- one of whom takes his  position as prefect all too seriously -- is very funny and very true.All  three books are magical, but this one has more depth than the first two.  As we learn more about Harry's parents -- their friends and the  circumstances of their death -- were learn more about Harry, the evil that  stalks him, and the strenght and wisdom of his supporters (especially  Dumbledore, the headmaster at Hogwarts).My wife and I have read all  three book out loud to our three boys (ages 8, 11, and 13).

But in the case of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I found a book that not only lived up to all my expectations, but completely blew them away.  JK Rowling has done a marvelous job developing and maturing the kids in this story, as Harry and co. now face the difficulties associated with adolescence in full bloom.  Jealousy, anger, love, and the realization that the world operates in complex ways that aren't always clear cut are just a few of the things that Harry encounters.  The author could have taken the easy way out and written a story that was easily predictable and aesthetically pleasing, but instead Rowling stuck to her guns and surprised me and cleverly developed this tale in ways I could have never imagined.  While the magic and charm of the first books are undeniable, I found this story just to be much more wholesome as this book more than any of the others showed the humanity of all involved.  The epic hero-villain tale is still there, but the grounding reality of the world Rowling has created makes the story much more relatable to readers, including me.  With all the hoopla and publicity surrounding the Harry Potter franchise, I'm glad to see that the books have continued to stay away from overblown glossy cliches, and have retained their sanctity by not only growing considerably in size, but in substance and emotion.  I highly recommend this book to people of all ages.",FALSE,2003,1468

It's true they did in forming the D.A., but in the big battle scene, I didn't see any unity from the other houses. There have been big rumors about Lilly's eyes and a big secret coming out in this book about her, but I didn't see one at all.Now the other little pieces of information were great. I'd like to have seen more handlings of the Toad in the end, but maybe next the next book. The death was played out unmercifully, not knowing WHO was to die. It was a shock, I'll tell you that. I also feel this character got the death they deserved and rightfully suited them.Read the book for all the magic, but it's not as spell bounding as we were hoping it would be.

Rowling has done it again, this book is the most complex, emotional, descriptive, clever, imaginative, action-packed, and mind-blowing book yet in the Harry Potter Series!I didn't think that any writer could write a book with the scope of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but I was clearly wrong!The emotion that Harry feels throughout this book will make you laugh, cry, and hope that he will suffer no more.  The puberty has taken over and Harry's anger is explosive...towards his friends, his family, and even towards dear Dumbledore!  The way J.K. lets you feel for Harry is like going on a day-in-the-life-journey of an angered individual!The action in this book did not have the wit of book 3 or 4, but the magic and adrenaline held you to the edge of your seat and took you on a magical rollercoaster ride!The characters were richly told, and flowed throughout the story with essence and descriptive life.  We met more characters in one book than ever, with vicious Professor Umbridge, venomous Kreatcher, lively and sometimes annoying Luna Lovegood, and the gentle-giant Grawp.  Each of these characters were unique in there own way and brought the tale to life!The book took a darker turn this time around, and even beat Prisoner of Azkaban, which in my opinion was the darkest in the series.  This was mostly because of the anger, prejudice, and hate in the Magical World at that point, and of course, the return of Lord Voldemort...I loved this book, each page was a masterpiece, and I was confident that it is the BEST in the Harry Potter series!  Mrs. Rowling certainly lived up to her expectations and did her absoulute best!  A classic!

"5590",4,731191,FALSE,"This is a good book overall.I thought it lacked something in plot, it was fairly obvious from mid-book how it was gonna end. And the stuff Dumbledore was gonna reveal wasn't anything you couldn't guess really. So a bit of a dissapointment.It was much darker than the other books and it's a book for older readers. Although I like most of that the lack of the ""funny-annoying"" characters was something I didn't like. There's no Rita Skeeter in this book.The girl who annoys us in this book is only veeery annoying :) And evil in a way Rita never was. Darker as I said.I was also hoping to see some new spells, but because of our Defense against Dark Arts teachers lack of skills we see little of it. And I must say, seeing all death eaters only screaming Avada Kedavra & Crucio will get disturbing in the end. It's ok so far though, just hope the next one will have some badass spells. If not it'll get repetetive.And to be a childrens book I thought Rowling made the bit too long, she could've made it shorter. I don't mind it though, just feel sorry for all the kids it doesn't take two days to finish :PAnyway, what makes up for it's mistakes are the character development, it's done nicely. You notice the characters really growing up. Thought Hermione, Neville & Dumbledore was really cool in this book :)Hermione is my favourite HP character, no doubt. Harry is a bit whiny, but I suppose it's his age. He was ok I guess and it's nice seeing he's not overly heroic in this book, that he can do mistakes. He's a bit badass against Dudley in the beginning of the book too. I like how Rowling makes her main character get away a bit from the ohhhSoooPure way he had before.

"5592",3,731190,FALSE,"Hmm... (or maybe even hem, hem, as the vile Prof. Umbridge would say), I'd have to say that this long-awaited offering is a rather uneven achievement. The character development is good, and there are plenty of new scenarioes, but I found this book a little slow-burning; it wasn't until about page 200 I felt JK was getting into her stride. The really strange thing is her attempt to woo her 'adult' audience with darker-than-ever subject, descriptions and overall tone, but still use kid's language. Some scenes in the book (particularly Harry's detentions) are disturbing, and perhaps not altogether suitable for younger readers. And then there's the issue of the much publicised death: I refuse to give the victim away, so not to spoil the book, but can't help feeling both upset and angry since aforementioned character is one of my very fabourites.  OP lacks plot and direction in places. The previous books all had an object: 1 the fight for the Stone, 2 trying to work out who/what was opening the Chamber of Secrets, 3 Sirius's break out and the revelation that the bad guy was infact good and 4 the Triwizard Contest. Here there were no such pointers, and it felt as though 650 pages were spent meandering waiting for Voldemort (who in my personal opinion is the weak link in the HP mythos). The customary bash-bang-wallop near the book's close wasn't as suspenseful, either.It doesn't have the fun of the other books. This might seem like a lame accusation to make, especially now it's moving into more serious, mature territory, but I sorely missed the... warm, glowing essence of Hogwarts. Harry spends the vast majority of this book hating Hogwarts, and wishing he could leave- meaning the tone for the entire book was angry and bitter, and making a reader thoroughly depressed.I read out of loyalty to the series, but I must say some of the magic has gone.",FALSE,2003,1469

The books that followed created a sensation like no other recorded in the history of the world, capturing the minds of kids and adults alike. However, as time passed, it got old and many people were waiting for over three years for the fifth book to be released. There were high expectations of its development. When it was released, many were disappointed. They said it was too long, too boring, and not worth the next wait. Needless to say, they abandoned it.The book was originally good, just different from its predecessors. 'Different' is never liked by those who are not true fans, for these are people whom are caught up in the moment, and Harry Potter was just a fad for them. For others, who were alone, frightened and somewhat insecure it was a dream, a beacon in the dark. For myself, it saved my life, literally. And no matter what, it always will be dear to those like us. Harry brought out the best in us, and was a true companion, though some refuse to now admit it. I enjoyed the book thoroughly, though I do believe that the author had been influenced and wanted her book to rival her last in size. The final plot was quickly thrown together and not as well done as her previous novels. I still remain loyal and will always adore it, despite the feelings other express. I encourage other long time fans to rally to Harry's aide, as he did to ours and keep our faith and wait for the next installment.

This is not Mary Poppins!I admire Ms. Rowling and her willingness to expand on the world that she's created.  She refuses to rest on her narrative laurels.  These characters are already fleshed out, yet she continues to give us new glimpses.  I was very happy that we learned more about Neville and Ginny.  Is there a better example of friendship in modern literature than between Harry, Ron, and Hermione?  And is there a better character for young girls to emulate?  Hermione is a three dimensional teen with brains, feelings, and chutzpah.I have read the reviews that lament the lack of ""closure"" in this book.  There really hasn't been a ""stand alone"" ending since Chamber of Secrets.  Azkaban ended with Wormtail and Sirius's escape. Goblet of Fire ended with Voldemort's return.  I doubt that Rowling will have another ""ending"" until Book 7, but I don't believe that this affects the quality of the story.All in all, this was a very satisfying read.  Umbridge makes Snape seem like Mary Lou Retton.  The corruption and unreliability of government seems all too timely.  The one thing that worries me is my belief that the last two books will involve a lot of carnage, which means characters I care about are going to be taking a dirt nap.

At first, my impression of this book would be one full of action and excitement, continuing the dark conclusion of book 4.  However, the first 500 pages of the book appear to be setting some stage and plot for the potentially violent acts in the upcoming 6th book.  I found that the style in book 5's opening made the reader slightly indifferent to the purpose and hideout of the Order of the Phoenix(since it's purpose is pretty obvious from its name).  I found myself awaiting some dark violent scene that would rival the dark scenes of the book's cover, and instead came upon a beautifully crafted plot.  You can tell right away, that the author catches the reader's attention with the first few chapters, then continues to pursue the promised rage and violence towards the book's concluding chapters.  The greatest present appearing from this book is the amazing detail and scope it provides of this magical world - taking the reader to places that were just mentioned in previous books.  As with the remainder of the series, book 5 answers several questions, and after satiating the reader's curiosity, it adds more questions to your mind as you read it.  The detail, reality, amazing imagination and imagery, plus the authentic creativity make this the best HP book yet.  After reading the 4th book, I thought it would be hard to beat the mystery with Moody as Crouch- but the events and complexity of this book make that look like a joke.

I'm enjoying the way Harry is developing and changing. In this book he often seems alone and confused, quite angry and proud. Who doesn't remember these feelings from the teen years. Of course, he's a teen born to fight evil. He has just a BIT more to handle than a common teen. This massive war between good and evil that the author is setting up is depressing, but it definitely keeps you wondering and guessing. Often you can't tell where she's going with a character, like Luna (in this book) who seems to be there to be laughed at - hopefully she'll come into her own like Neville. I really enjoy the way Neville is becoming important in the story. I enjoy Ron, too - I can picture him as a real person, and not because I've seen an actor play him in the movies. I like the way the author slips in someone new and interesting just when a character like that seems to be needed, like the sly Phineas Nigellus in this book. I love her complex adult characters like Snape, who's actually Harry's ally but an extremely unlikeable individual. Her truly unlikeable characters like Umbridge in this book truly make you suffer along with the kids. Rowling so often reminds us that adults can be truly cruel. Harry faces a lot of turmoil and continued loss, and we know that in the upcoming books he'll have to find even more reserves of strength. Life is definitely not easy in the Harry Potter books.

REVELATIONS.Also, Harry's headlong dive into teen angst became a little tiresome as the book progressed. I altrenated between feeling bad for the guy, and simply wanting to slap him. I guess you have to give the kid a mulligan though, he has had it bit rough these past couple of years what with The Dark Lord, basilisks, Malfoy and the like.All this to say, that it was a great read, and I can't wait to dive into Ms. Rowling's next go... in I'm guessing 2006 or so?",FALSE,2003,1470
"5611",5,731193,FALSE,"Congratulations are due to Ms. Rowling; this novel is a stellar accomplishment.Fans of the series won't be disappointed.  All of the necessities are here.  Quirky magic classes and professors, rebellious adventures in Hogwarts, Quidditch, inventive magical creatures and artifacts, illuminating backstory, and an intricate plot with an explosive climax.This book stands out in the series due to its intricate plotting.  By page two, we're already in the thick of a hair-raising adventure that doesn't quit for almost 900 pages.  I can think of no other novel that keeps up such a high level of excitement over such a long stretch.  Most impressive is that every single piece of the immense plot fits neatly into the whole arc of the story.The climactic scene stretches impressively over some 200 pages, ultimately involving every major character in the story.  The author takes us to horrifying, dark and mysterious places, and puts her heroes in great danger.  I literally felt my heart racing as I read the last quarter of the book in one frenzied sitting.Then, after dragging us along for a magnificent thrillride, the author lets us in on secrets and backstory we always wanted to know.  By the time the book is done, the Harry Potter universe has a new level of complexity and all of a sudden events from previous novels take on a new significance.As the fastest-selling novel ever (until Book 6 I'm sure), Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix isn't likely to get the critical praise it deserves -- critics are notoriously unfriendly to mass market entertainment.  But the achievement in this novel cannot be understated.  JK Rowling has put together a novel that is touching, poignant, and most of all, engrossing.

I no longer feel as if the main characters (Harry, Ron and Hermione) are best of friends and willing to do whatever it takes to keep it that way. In Fact, most of the personalities of our well known, previously introduced characters disappoint.  This cannot be explained  as a result of the circumstances of the storyline, but rather it feels as Ms. Rowling has just lost touch with her characters.It also feels as if the author was just making up plot devices as she went along and was just not careful enough to tie them together nicely... everything feels very contrived and false.Another problem is that there is no strong antagonist. Unlike the other novels, Harry is not constantly searching for something or battling something directly. He seems to travel haphazardly through the main plot just ""fuming"" at everything and showing very little of the character that he had in the first 4 books. The reader is not even remotely engaged with the book because there is little action going on, causing the entire book to drag on.I could go on and on, as there are so many problems large and small within this installment, but I will leave it to other readers to add to this or refute with their own version.

Fortunately, this is not the case as J.K. Rowling steps up and writes the best Harry Potter book so far.First things first, the story.  Though this book is slightly edgier than the previous four, and deals with the subjects of loss, grief, anxiety, and plain old stress, it all manages to come together into a work that can be enjoyed by almost anyone.  Taking off where The Goblet of Fire left off, you can actually see the changes in Harry as he gets older both emotionally and through his new level of curiosity.  It seems that we have left the 11 year old from the first book, and now have a teen to deal with, which only adds to the realism of the series, and makes it easier for the reader to relate to his experiences on a non-magical level.  Cho Chang, Harry's love interest, finally comes to play a part in his life, bringing more complications, and bringing the story closer to reality.  It's the little things, not just the main plotline that make this book really shine, and the detail that Rowling puts into it is simply amazing.The writing itself has developed quite a lot since the previous books.  Rowling writes at a level that is understandable to anyone, including the younger part of the Harry Potter fanbase.  But if you look at the book on a deeper level, there's a lot to gain even for grownups.This is one of the best books I've read recently, and I recommend it to absolutely anyone who wants to be totally swept away to a world that is magical in more than just the literal ways.

I promptly began to read, and I have to say....I am somewhat disappointed in it.  Though I believe J K Rowling to be an excellent writer in general, I found the fifth book not nearly as engrossing as the last three.  In fact, throughout the entire first half I was left wondering, ""when is something going to HAPPEN?!"".  I found Harry to be more irritating than anything else, what with his constant outbursts, lack of judgement, and incessant whining.  Hermione seems to be the only character that is maturing at all.  The plot was not as well developed as I thought it could have been (c'mon, there are like nine hundred pages here!), and frankly the resolution (if you can call it that) took an absurdly long time to arrive.  [...]  Don't get me wrong, it was nice to hear what Harry has been up to, and I genuinely adore this series as a whole.  I just felt that JK Rowling's talent is seriously under-utilized here.  There is a persistent lack of focus, a rambling, largely unexciting plot, and for the most part the characters become lost in the jumble.  This could've been better!! I rate it 3 out of 5.",FALSE,2003,1467
"5619",4,731190,FALSE,"The fifth installment of JK Rawling's Harry Potter series is easily identified as the point where the author has decided to hammer home the fact that Harry is no longer a child.  Harry is no longer the happy-go-lucky Hogwarts kid who is in wide eyed and pleasant wonder of the Magical world, he has become snappy with his friends, withdrawn, and occasionally explosively angry.  Harry spends much of this novel fuming about some thing or another.  He's been sulky before, but never for an entire book.Not that this is all Harry's fault.  After being nearly universally recognized as a ""hero"" due to his unwitting near destruction of Lord Voldemort, now the Wizarding newspapers have been painting him as a delusional and disturbed young man who is very dangerous.  Now when people stare at him, it's out of fear or disgust, not awe.There is a lot more action and scary sequences in this book, and Harry's interest in girls is becoming slightly less G-Rated.  The biggest change, however, is the storyline itself.  It is no longer something the average 12 year old could pick up and instantly get involved in, the plotline is tangled and some sequences are just plain confusing.All in all, I liked this book the least of all the current titles.  It's still a very good book, but it's just got a totally different feel than the previous ones.  It's more like a Tom Clancy novel than a charming tale of innocent magic.",FALSE,2003,1469

Harry is poised for a rite of passage, then we are led into some pointless action to save a ""weapon"" that didn't need to exist, ending in an obvious revelation we already knew.Just as Harry is the boy who didn't die, Order of the Pheonix is the book that didn't end.

Now, I saw some people have trashed the book saying that the beginning is dragged out alot...  And truth be told, It SEEMS that way when your reading it...  I mean, until Harry got to school the book seemed to drag on and on for me...  But, it was my mistake for not paying enough attention to the book as is needed for the first few chapters...  For if you dont pay attention in the begging chapters you will regret it towards the end of the book...  So what seems like a dragged out beggining of a book trust me, pay attention to it and look for any little clues whatsoever, because it really has an excellent beggining if you notice all the clues leading up to the end...  And now I have seen many reviews on her giving away who dies in the end...  J.K. told everyone that someone important would die in this book, and not knowing who it is until they kick the bucket is extremly exciting so if you read this reveiw I urge you dont read another for there are many spoilers in them...

"5626",5,731182,FALSE,"I entered the wonderful wizarding world a little over a year ago, just before the first movie was released.  I had seen previews of the movie and they looked intriguing enough to check out the 1st book.  Well, 4 sleepless nights later on a Friday I had finished all four books, and my boss was ready to send me to the hospital for some unknown malady ( I couldn't exactly tell him I'd been up reading all week).I was a woman enthralled, for Harry Potter had put a spell on me.  The characters were amazingly complex and 3-dimensional, the plots were rich and interweaving, and I couldn't wait for the next one to come out.  For the HP books were and are NOT children books, they are books about growing up, and dealing with life.Waiting for the OotP to be released was insufferable, and I only had to wait a year and a half instead of three, but it was more than worth the wait.  In this book, gone is the wide eyed innocence of youth. No, HP is angry, pompous, edgy, confused, and he's not going to take it anymore.  In other words, he's 15.  Right from the beginning, the book starts with action, plot twists, intrigue, and drama, and doesn't end even when the book is over.Still reeling from the trauma of Cedric's death and Voldemort's return, HP's story begins right after his birthday, and as usual, miserable at the Dursley's, and feeling cut off from his friends.  They write to him, but tell him nothing.  Something unexpected happens that causes him to be in big trouble with the Ministry of Magic, and reunites him with old friends and enemies, and introduces him to new allies and foes.No longer the HP loving government, the MoM wants him wandless and discredited, for they are ABSOLUTELY unwilling to believe in Voldemort's return.  Harry comes before the court and we find out what prats Fudge and Percy can be, while also meeting the malicious, vile, Delores Umbridge, who makes Snape look kind and generous.Here enters the OotP, working in secret for fear of punishment from the government against he-who-shall-not-be-named.  Returning favorites Snuffles (Sirius Black), Lupin, Mad-Eye-Moody, the Weasley's, and of course Dumbledore are all members.  It is here Harry is reunited with his friends Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasley children (sans Percy).  Harry discovers that Voldemort is after some secret weapon, but the order won't give him any specifics.Although sullen, he returns to Hogwarts with high hopes for the year.  Unfortunately, that Umbridge woman is the new DAD teacher.  She makes Harry's life a living torment.  Pretty soon she's all but taken over the school, and becomes a menace to everyone, teachers and students included, although Dumbledore does impede her with regularity.To make matters worse, this is the year that 5th years take their OWL's.  Every teacher has given them a colossal amount of homework in preparation.  In addition, his scar is hurting worse than ever and almost non-stop.  Plus, he's constantly dreaming about a long corridor with a blue light and a door at the end.  Unsure of its meaning, he doesn't know who to turn to for advice, for Dumbledore won't speak to him or even look at him.  He can't talk to Sirius as they are monitoring the Floo network and the owl post.  Malfoy and Snape are as delightful as ever.  Snape is, however shown in a new light, and we come to understand him a little better.The one thing guaranteed to alleviate Harry's anxiety, and what he likes to do above all else is taken from him.  In retaliation, the triumphant trio form the DA and recruit other students who believe in Voldemort's return and want to be prepared.  All of this leads to a climatic confrontation involving the MoM, OotP, Voldemorte & his Death Eaters, and the DA.It is here while protecting the weapon that Harry suffers a tragic loss that is at once poignant and heart rending, and which impact was barely covered and will definitely affect the two books to come.  It also brings about the revelation of why ole Tom Riddle tried to kill Harry as a baby and what will have to happen by the series conclusion.Without Ron or Hermione, I don't know how Harry would have made it through the year.  You can see how much they have grown over the last 4 years, and forged an unbreakable bond.  For the reader, you will definitely be grateful for the Weasley twins as they are a refreshing touch of levity in an otherwise emotional book.There is so much more that could be discussed, but I don't want to give too much away, and there just isn't enough space.  Many people are sure to mention this book is dark, and that is true, but with good reason.  JKR stays true to her characters and her story and the reader will appreciate it.  The only problem I have with this book is that it ended much too soon.  Nope, 780 pages just aren't enough.  I'm already feeling the effects of withdrawal from this imaginative masterpiece, and fear that the wait will prove to be as unbearable as Harry's 5th year.Ending on a happy note, I read an interview with JKR that said she has already started the 6th book!

The book follows the course similarly applied by her other books (intro w/ Dursleys, Train to Hogwarts, education time, final exams, back to Dursleys) but this echoes the lives of every school age kid; if Harry didn't follow this pattern it would be less realistic.  There are a ton new characters and more about the wizarding world as a whole.  Tensions heat up as Harry gets [upset] about his position as a child with a man's heart (don't we all).

It's probably because I've spent a long time reading fanfic's while waiting for this book to come out. The death was a disappointment, but I'm sure J.K. Rowling did it for a good reason. She wouldn't just kill off a character just for the heck of it, would she?? This book was slow in some parts, but I still couldn't put it down! The ending was a disappointment. Dumbledore's ""I'm going to tell you everything I should have told you five years ago"" seemed too predictable. When I finished this book... I was depressed. This book is so sad! And I'm right along side Harry at the end. He's depressed, I'm depressed. Harry Potter Depression. I know I have said a lot of my ""disappointments"" about the book, but really overall it's a great book! Just me being a die hard Harry Potter fan, I think I got my expectations way too high over the three year wait. So don't take as long on the next book, okay J.K.???! : ) I'm sure when all seven books come out in the series, everything will make more sense and all the puzzle peices will be put together and I'll love each Harry Potter book equally.

This is a plot where it turns the smartest wizard of the age, Professor Albus Dumbledore, against the Ministry of Magic. It seems that Fudge, Minister of Magic, has chosen to retain his title of Minister rather than save those people who do not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned to power in mid-spring of Harry's fourth year. After many conflicts and  verbal and physical battles, it turns Ministry of Magic totally against Albus Dumbledore and was forced to be removed from headmaster of Hogwarts. It is for Harry and company to again save the school from evil events, but this time the whole magic community and also muggles.

Without Harry's true-dreams, they are able to make themselves into the Ministry of Magic and into a very secretive room where Harry and company struggle to escape death eaters while being equipped with a prophecy they want that has Harry Potter's name on it. There is a very horrific death in this book and is one of my favourite characters (my lips are sealed).

It had its silly moments, witch were still exceptionally entertaining, but there were more serious events throughout this volume than in any of the others.

The harry potter series is often thought of as ""just some children's books"" by people who have only seen the movies, or people who just refuse to read the book. Quite the contrary, they are fairly deep and kept even my attention, while in turn stimulating my greatly starved adult imagination.  They are very simple reads, where a normal near 1000 page book (like LOTR) might take me a week to read, these books, no matter what lenght take only a day or two to read.  The evolution of the characters can sometimes seem fulfilling.  Beginning with the first book, I felt like an outsider, just observing everything in the book, but as the series progresses, Rawlings has made me fill more involved in the book.I have noticed with the 4 previous books she starts out at an extremely slow pace, just barely manages to throw in enough details to keep me from putting down the book, and then within the last few chapters she crams enough action, adventure and exposed secrets to make me dizzy for a bit.  Order of the Pheonix is no different.  I did find it a bit more slow than the previous books though.  I did see an ad for an interview with Rawlings on some morning show, and she mentioned that someone important dies.

You will be shocked at what Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, told Harry after he said that he should have told Harry 5 years ago. My friends told me not to give it away and I personally do agreed with them because you want a story to be exciting and unexpected.

Rowling's longest HP installment, and because of the craftiness of her past books, I expected HP 5 to contain her trademark cleverly-hidden foreshadowings and mind-boggling, gasp-out-loud plot twists. I was left, however, disappointed, as the few events you could consider to be plot twists were quite feeble, and for the first time in my life as a Harry Potter fan, I felt as though the length of the book served as a hindrance.Don't get me wrong-it wasn't terrible, nor was it mediocre. It was still very good, and many of the subplots were still charmingly witty and entertaining in that unique, J.K. Rowling way.

The development of the Weasleys, Hermione, the Order members and Neville (in particular) was excellent. I loved the chapter which included Snape's worst memory. The overall dark mood of the book also worked in HP 5's favor. I just felt like the book was missing something crucial.All in all, I thought HP 5 was good, but not Rowling's best. I only hope that HP 6 will contain some divine revelation that gives meaning and purpose to the seemingly excessive contents of HP 5. In the event that a revelation does not occur, I will view HP 5 as the ""awkward phase"" of Harry's growth, as well as Rowling's writing styles-a phase necessary to reach maturity and to realize one's full potential.",FALSE,2003,1476

Parents should carefully guide their children as they read this; perhaps reading it aloud with them would be helpful.  But don't get me wrong, it is a great novel.  Just a little more advanced than the some of the other books.And as always, it is important to take this book and find a way to use it to The Glory of The Most High Father God.  So for those who are in protest of this series, try looking at it from another point.This is a very influential series considering that over five or more years it has sold over 200,000,000 copies, so why not take that influence and use it to tell people about God and bring them to know Jesus?For anyone who has questions about how to use this series to bring people to Christ and also to teach their children about God and Christ, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING CONNIE NEAL'S  WHAT'S A CHRISTIAN TO DO WITH HARRY POTTER?

I won't waste any words on the plot, suffice to say that everything you've probably gathered by now is not enough to prepare you.Rowling seems to have cured her slight pacing problem from the last book, and even though Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is considerably longer than Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it is so filled with events and happenings that it goes by considerably faster.  It's more high adventure and learning lessons.  This also continues the darkening tone of the series, and its end promises considerably more darkness for the future.In spite of the gravity of this volume, though, Rowling fills it with more of her charm.

Harry deals with a horrible new teacher, a crush on a classmate, hiding his connection and friendship with Sirius Black, and the fear of the return of Lord Voldemort. Not to mention the many other things a fifteen-year-old boy goes through.A common trend that I have noticed is that in nearly all the books of the series, Harry has had to deal with the death of someone very dear to him.  This is true again in the fifth book.  Another thing that troubles Harry during his fifth year at Hogwarts is his reoccurring dreams.  At first, Harry dreams of people being murdered but then he begins to dream about a long hallway with a single black door. Harry has this dream nearly every night and he keeps getting closer and closer to the door.  Then one night in Harry's dream he reached the door but was unable to open it. Harry feels he needs to tell someone other than his fellow classmates, but in a twist of events, any of the adults he would have been comfortable talking to, are not available to confide in.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a very good novel, but also a very long one.

The new defense against the dark arts teacher is a great and imaginative character but i must say, Ron as a prefect?? Ron as a Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team??

The characters have the same old dilemnas, with the exception of ""hormonal"" ones.  These are the least pleasant of the predicaments- Harry's ""girlfriend"" is a twit, yet she's treated like she's not.It's obvious that J.K. Rowling is having a more difficult time telling the story than she was before.  I expect the Harry Potter's will get longer and longer, as it takes Rowling longer and longer to say what she must.In addition, she seems to be growing less creative.  Much of the inevitable last-hundred-pages climax centers around a prophecy, which Voldemort knows about but didn't hear because he was kicked out of the pub before he heard it, and is now searching for.  The prophecy turns out to be rather pointless, divulging information that should be grave but is what the readers should already know.There are high points, though: it is explained exactly why Petunia took Harry in if she hated his mother so much, and why Voldemort can't kill Harry. However the secrets are revealed in a very formulaic way in which the phrase, ""I'm too old to understand youth anymore and that's why I haven't told you anything yet"" appears about ninety-seven times.The book has the usual round-the-year feel about it, which is actually pleasant, but it ends about forty pages too late and the end feels both stolen from the last four and too mishy-mashy.If it had taken me more than a day to read, then I might be angry, however, it did not, and for fluff it was pretty good.",FALSE,2003,1468

I spent almost all my time after I bought the book, reading it, because it is a book that you can hardly set it down. Although it was almost 900 pages, the book speeds by. Although many people think that this book is much too long to be a children's book, I beg to differ, because reading this long of book gives a child a wonderful feeling of accomplishment. I really wish that these books were not 3 years apart ( as the goblet of fire and the order of the pheonix were) because I realized it was harder to beleive that Harry was 15 and also, during those 3 years many readers lose interest. That is, until it comes time for its release, when it is on every news statioin and is widely anticipated. The next Harry Potter movie comes out in June 2004 but, although they are wonderful movies and books, I really wish they wouldn't keep us waiting so long. If WarnerBrothers makes the Harry Potter movies up to year 7 at this slow of rate ( one about every 2 years), I am afraid many Harry Potter readers will lose interest. This is simply because, by the time #7 comes out, it will have been 14 years, and many child readers will be in their 20's! Also, unless they get other young actors for the movie, people such as Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe will be much too old to look thir parts. All in all, I love the books and movies, but J.K.

All the favorite characters get their turns here, with some revealing developments, but at the same time, the book sets the stage for the next novel, with a lot to anticipate (and dread).  This book is a major change from what we've come to expect in Harry's world, and the changes may shock (and even turn away) some readers.  But Rowling proves her writing skills are second to none with all of the twists, turns and upheavals that constantly catch readers off-guard.

I came late to the Potter series, but was among the first in line to buy this one. After this installment, I'll certainly do the same for the next.  Though she's telling a tale of epic scope, she doesn't forget that it is the characters that matter most and - unlike Tolkien (though I still have great respect for his work) - every page is interesting and often important. Her accurate depiction of adults and children of all ages is, perhaps, the most compelling thing about her stories. She very, very rarely forgets that the actions of characters must make sense. She has made comments indicating that she really cares about these characters, and she manages to make us care about them, too.  She has always been good with characterization, though. What really set ""Goblet of Fire"" apart was the fact that we began to see should could also write an epic story. She does the same in ""Order of the Phoenix.""

This metaphor for pre-WW II England, and maybe for 2003 in general, is potent. The small band of resistance fighters who constitute the Order of the Phoenix are plagued with profound frustrations which take almost all the fun out of being alive--Cereus cannot safely step outside to get even a simple breath of fresh air, Dumbledore can't even look Harry in the eye, and Harry, kept deliberately in the dark about his long term destiny, has to carry on in almost the total absence of opportunities to ventilate.Yes, Rowlings has chosen to carry her vivid and beloved characters forward into the real world as it must be lived for anyone to stand a meaningful stand against evil. Only the Death Eaters and Fred and George Weasly seem to be enjoying themselves from day to day. Nonetheless, this does not add up to a depressing read. As always, the world author Rowlings creates is vivid, compelling, and a wonderful shared experience for the entire family, who will find plenty to discuss and think about. We loved this book.

There is also some nice satire, with the Ministry of Magic and Professor Umbridge showing off the idiocy and destructive power of unfettered beaurocracy...Easily my least favorite Potter so far.  Not terrible, but I sure hope the last two books give a greater measure of high spirits, humor and a sense of wonder along with the inevitable sturm und drang.",FALSE,2003,1470
"5675",5,731190,FALSE,"If the sixth book of the Harry Potter series is going to be as good as this one, I won't mind waiting another three years.  Not much, anyway.Rowling uses the familiar framework of the first three books to anchor us as she takes Harry through the rough year following Voldemort's return.  Like many another fifteen year old, Harry spends a lot of time being angry at the restrictions imposed by adults, and the unfairness of the world. And in his case some of the complaints are valid.  He's not just paranoid, there really is a campaign going on to discredit him and make him look foolish.  And to make things worse, there are the nightmares...I won't spoil the plot -- the suspense was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book -- suffice it to say that the twists and turns are wonderful, and there are places where I was cheering and places where I had to stop and put the book down and go for a walk before I could go on.  Some questions are answered, and new ones come hard on their heels.In this volume, Rowling has really given the other characters a chance to move into the forefront -- not just the new folks, but old friends as well. (And if I wanted to reach through the pages and shake a few of the ""old friends"" it was only because they were making the kinds of mistakes that showed their humanity.) People mentioned in earlier books show up too, fully fleshed characters now.

We began reading it together the day it came out and I was dissapointed at first at how long it took the story to begin to devlop. Tom Clancy has become guilty of the same thing (ever increasing story lengths)but I still love to read him as well. Anyway, I took the book with me on a cross country business trip and found that once I got about 1/2 way through, I couldn't put it down. The action is the most intense and sustained of the 5 books, although the end of book 4 was extremely intense as well, and the pace moves along briskly. The real pay off is in the last third of the book where you learn much about the underlying plot of the entire saga as well as many new facts about some of the other characters. The additional information about characters other than Harry, Hermione, and Ron give them much richer texture and you find you will have stronger feelings about characters you previously knew only superficially.After I finished the book I couldn't wait to continue reading it with my daughter (it was hard not to spill the beans). It is a long read but, in the end, well worth the investment in time. I do hope that Ms. Rowling will crisp up the next book and not make us wait too long.

This book is written by J.K Rowling and the theme of the book is mostly fantasy and horror.  The setting of the book is in Harry's uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia house that is also shared by his cousin Dudley. Another setting is at Harry's magical school Hogwarts. In my opinion the better of the settings is Hogwarts because there is more to do there and anything could happen there. When Harry goes to Hogwarts after running away form home he finds out that a madman who escaped form Azakaban (a magical prison for evil wizards and witches) is after him. Harry arrives to Hogwarts (school for young witches and wizards) and starts a new year with the thought of this madman in his head. During the year he finds out a bunch of information about this man including his name which is Sirous Black and that this man used know his parents. Also this man killed about 15 mugles (non-magic people). During the whole year Harry has obstacles to overcome and information he must find out for himself. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azakaban is one of the best books of the Harry Potter serious. This book is full of excitement, surprises and terror.

In the end, we are brought to know great pain and sorrow along with with Harry as he suffers loss beyond measure, and is taken to the very heart of a chaotic swirl of the forces of good, evil, and what lies in-between.What can be said here, it is really hard to say. Anyone who reads this book is likely to come away thinking differently. It is (something that could not as easily be said about Harry Potter up to this point) a story about struggle, about unredeemable mistakes, about horrible sorrow and loss.

The ending of this book definitely made me wish that Book 6 was closer to being finished.

So much happens over the summer, that the students don't even get back to Hogwarts until page 200!  Harry meets dementors again, gets very close to getting expelled, doesn't make prefect, goes through the normal teenage angst of first date, needs to worry about his fifth year O.W.L.S., there's a new 'Grand Inquisitor' at Hogwarts threating to sack some of Harry's favorite professors, Hagrid is nowhere to be found for quite a bit in the book, several death eaters have escaped from Azkaban, no one believes Harry that Voldemort is back and Voldemort, is as usual, up to something evil and on top of all of this Harry has to take extra Occlumens lessons with his least favorite professor, Snivellus Snape.It was a good read, but I didn't overall find it as entrancing as book 4.

However, after reading the entire book on it's first weekend of release, I was left feeling quite a bit disappointed.  I should first say that I have read the prior 4 books, twice, and loved them a great deal.  After Goblet of Fire all I could think of was how great the book 5 would be since the Dark Lord had officially returned.  It seemed like action and excitement were bound to be unleashed on us in book 5.  That wasn't the case for me though.  By the time I hit page 500 I was getting bored, waiting for the pace to pick up.  Nothing of any real consequence had happened.  Nothing of permanence to Harry or his friends.  A new professor and the Ministry of Magic were meddling with school affairs and that was about it.  Of course, in the last 150 pages or so, the pace speeds up and a death occurs that should have lasting repercussions (but felt a little...anti-climactic somehow), but unlike every other book where I felt the story had advanced by the end, I feel like Harry and his world are at the same place now they were at by the end of Goblet of Fire.  While a necessary read of any Potter fan because of the death in the last 150 pages, most of the first 700 pages feel stretched out and needless.  Perhaps if the book had been edited down to 450 or 500 pages I would have overlooked the almost non-existent advancement of the plot of the series in this book.

Harry Potter fans should be satisfied, for now.There's no question that the tone of this installment in the series is darker. In his fifth year at Hogwart's, Harry is growing up in many ways, and teen angst has set in. He continually questions and rebels against authority figures (often with good reason, as it turns out), struggles with his friends and peers, and thinks much more about girls (or at least, one particular girl). His school year gets off to a bad start, grows increasingly difficult and ominous, and reaches a climax in which a cherished friend meets a tragic fate in the battle against Voldemort...Well, let's hope we don't have to wait too long to hear about Harry's sixth year!Notes to parents -  The behavior of many of the major characters in this book is harsher and more mean-spirited  than in earlier volumes. We expect it from Snape and Voldemort's minions, but now it seems to come from all quarters. I personally felt that the portrayal of adults as complex characters with many flaws (sometimes tragic) results in a richer mix. At any rate, it should appeal to teenagers. Harry's emotional trials will also be familiar to many teens, but I'm not sure how younger readers will respond. I would think carefully about how appropriate the book is for under-10 children.

After the book, I was left wondering about some things and felt that many questions were left unanswered or answered only vaguely.Nonetheless, I have to admit that this book was captivating and exciting.  The writing is very descriptive, without being flowery.  And despite complaints that the book did not have enough action, each chapter leaves you longing for more.

Although JK was probrably trying to add some realistic emotion to her book, I must say that even as a serious Harry Potter reader, I don't want to read about an angry, hot-headed guy! I mean, part of Harry's charm was the fact that he could duel with Voldemort and ALWAYS be modest and himself. In this book, he was hostile, arrogant, and wanted credit for everything- not the Harry I knew.Secondly, although there was every type of twist and turn imaginable in that book, but the 840th page, I was sighing in relief. I think JK might have been a little desperate to stuff as much into the book as possible, which is not the Harry Potter style that everyone usually loves.My last complaint against the 5th book was the revelation of a profecy being the reason Harry was attacked as a baby. The thing that JK can usually be commended with is originality, but this time, she couldn't even pull that off.

JK Rowling's style of writing is fluid and undaunting. i love how seamlessly she mingled the darkness and the humor and how accurately she captured the growing maturity of harry potter. harry's frustration with dumbledore's virtually ignoring him is, instead of bottled up, acted out to the point where he is screaming at his friends. this frustration is a pivotal part in the book and so well conveyed by Rowling. the darker tone and mood was an expected and welcome change to her previous books and the underlying sense of danger and peril throughout made the last hundred pages a race to find out what would happen next. the addition of many new characters as well as the return of old favorites made the story richer and more readable as well. lupin, sirius, and moody were colorful and lively in every way. dolores umbridge as the new DADA teacher added a new level of evil to the mix -- the type of evil that can be found in people who come from places that are usually associated with trying to fight it, namely the wizard government, the ministry of magic. the revelations in this book are many and will surely drive the final two (sniff, only two left) to a stunning and satifying conclusion. this book is stocked with heavy themes that have been festering since the sorcorer's stone that perhaps younger readers cannot pick up on, but truly makes the older potter fanbase more riveted to the series than it ever was. i know i couldn't put it down.",FALSE,2003,1470

Everybody believes he's after Harry and he hopes to use him to bring back the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Like the other books, J. K.

"5713",5,731190,FALSE,"Incredible.  JK Rowling has crafted a novel that is, at once, an angst-filled coming-of-age story about a confused, angry 15 year old boy well as a suspenseful, heart-stopping thrill ride.  Harry in this edition is very angry about not being more involved in the hunt for Voldermort--something that directly affects him.  This anger is shown in many ways as he lashes out at both enemies and friends and mentors.  Adults become more fallible and Harry, we learn at some frustrating points, is only a teenager.  The only one that seems to have their head on straight is Hermione Granger, who is quickly becoming my favorite character.  In fact, Harry's dismissal of her advice towards the end of the novel directly leads to the death of someone very close to him which angers and hurts him even more.  Rowling is a master because most of us were aware that someone was going to die.  But she throws so many people into the mix, that, at the end, we have no idea who it is.  The death is that much more tragic and powerful because of it.  This book sets up the next two in an exciting way.  What will become of the newly formed Order of the Phoenix?  How will the prophecy be fulfilled?  Who will live to see the vanquishment of Voldermort?  Can I stand the wait to find out?

For me, I liked it as much as the third book (my favorite before this one).  This book is shocking because it is intense, in the beginning Harry's life is turned upside down and it is funny. At the beginning, Harry's life is turned upside down.  Aunt Petuina is asking questions about magic.  Miss Figg, an old lady down the lane who babysits Harry, turns out to be a squib!  The letters Harry is getting from his friends are mysterious.  Could his friends know something he doesn't know?  This is a weird beginning.This book is gets even weirder and is the most intense one of the whole series.  Rowling is still not afraid to kill or hurt main characters.  You would be surprised who dies.  Another way this book is the most intense is when Harry asks Dumbledore some questions and finally gets some real answers. Phoenix has some bright parts.  It is the funniest of the five.  When Ron joins Harry on the Quidditch team the Slytherins sing a song-Weasley can't save a thing, Weasley can't block a thing, Weasley is our king.""  Fred and George open a joke shop.  Two of the funniest lines are when Hermonie says, ""Don't listen to Malfoy, he might make life difficult for you"" and Harry answers, ""Gee I wonder what it must be like to have a difficult life.""

"5718",4,731189,FALSE,"I received the book on Saturday morning, June 21, at about 10:00 AM. By 7:00 AM on Sunday I had finished it; I suppose that suggests that the book keeps one's interest.It is unquestionably the darkest book in the series, virtually unrelieved by humor, except humor which is itself dark and at times depressing. Harry himself is less likeable; possibly this is characteristic of his being 15, (and maybe I'm having trouble remembering back that far), but the rages begin to wear thin after a while, and the reasons for them aren't always apparent.It's not giving away a secret to say that a major character dies at the end, but much of the traumatic impact of that death is lost because that character has become flawed throughout the book; I, at least, had a sense that he had no future, and therefore didn't think it a great loss when he was gone. Had that same character died in an earlier book, I would have been much more affected.Even the climactic seen at the end lacked the power of the confrontation in book 4 (or even of book 2).I would still like to see more of Snape; I still don't know why he saved Harry in book 1, and what turned him away from Voldemort. I would also like to see more of Aunt Petunia, now that she has opened up a little; possibly both of these issues are waiting for one of the two remaining books.The end of book 4 left me wanting to know more; I couldn't wait for book 5.

"5719",5,730798,FALSE,"I would like to say that the third Harry Potter book so far has been the best book of the series yet, I highly reccomend it to everyone.  At first I thought this series of books was for young children, I then began to see more adults reading the Harry Potter books, in turn I picked up the first book, started reading it, and could not put it down.  I have now moved through the first, second and now third book and am anxiously awaiting to read the fourth.  I have found this specific series of books is not only telling a story about a young boy living a rough life, becoming a wizard, and trying to find out who actually killed his parents but it tells real life morals and it teaches us many ways in which we can handle many different situations.  I think it is interesting to see throughout these books how Harry has handled many of these difficult situations in his life.  In this book Harry learns much about his past and about his parents, and discovers that the person in prison for his parents death is not really the alleged killer.  This book reminds me of being on a roller coaster because it turns around many different ways, sometimes leaves you hanging.  Once you think you have it all figured out it all drastically changes on you.  I had trouble at times putting this book down, it is filled with suspense and knowledge, as well as showing Harry's bravery and courageous character.  J.K. Rowling has done a terrific job with this series of books; I can't wait to read the fourth book.  I almost guarantee you will love and and enjoy the creativeness put into this book!",FALSE,2002,1077
"5720",3,731220,FALSE,"I applaud the author's attempt to make Harry more realistic as he enters into his teen years.  Harry became more likeable and less of a goody-goody.  In future books, I'd like to see him lean more towards the Dark Side in order to learn his enemy's tricks and deal with its temptations (perhaps unsuccessfully?).  I'd even like to see him deal with the moral dilemma of having to take a life.  In other words, how about more of an edge to the character?My chief criticism of the Order of the Phoenix, as well as the first four books in the series, is that the story is told entirely from Harry's point of view.  The story would have been better served with chapters that had nothing to do with Harry and instead got inside of the heads of Hermione, Sirius, or even Draco Malfoy, for example, in order to make those characters less predictably unidimensional.  There were some passages where Harry had an out-of-body experience with another Not-To-Be-Named character which made for tantalizing reading.  It was as if we, the readers, got to ditch Harry for a while and pick up a piece of the story from that other character's perspective.  It was only a teaser though since the experience was still Harry's and he shared with the reader his impressions and reactions to it afterwards.  Cutting Harry entirely out of the loop for a chapter has great potential to enhance future books in this series.Lastly, there were a lot of parallels to The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  As a response to this criticism and in defense of J.K. Rowling, I'd simply say that how could she not be influenced by the greatest fantasy literary work of all time?!",FALSE,2003,1499

However, it was on special, so I grabbed it, took it home and started reading. Two days later I was done, it was that compelling.I found Harry to be slightly less likable in this book, although I could understand the reasons for his changes in character. Possibly a small complaint is that Hermione and Ron have hardly changed at all since they were 11, while Harry has become a full blown angst ridden teenager. This is handled quite well, although his moping does grate after a while.The series is maturing, presumably apace with the readers. There are some themes here that weren't even hinted at in earlier books, and the suggestion that its going to get darker and more mature still. I found the experience of reading the book as a whole slightly depressing, similar in a way to some of Harrys experiences at Hogwarts, which he describes as 'Odd notes in a familiar tune' (I forget the exact quote). We're used to the routine of the books by now, and it's slightly altered in this one, which is disconcerting. This is not necessarly a bad thing, and I'm still greatly looking forward to the next in the series.It's not all doom and gloom however.

"5722",5,731252,FALSE,"An absolutely superb book and in my [humble] opinion - the best one she has written. Harry is going through a period of self-doubt and bitterness throughout the novel, and JKR lets us see right inside his head. I think it has disturbed some of the younger readers to see their hero questioning friendships and trying to cope with being misunderstood by the people all around him. He has moments where his temper and self-importance get the better of him, and he lashes out at a world that is on the brink of turning its back on him. Finally Harry has been brought as close to ""real"" as he can be, by letting us see that he's just a boy - with a gift - trying to get through the challenges of adolesence 1 day at a time. He saw a friend murdered last year and his parents murderer restored to full strength - lets cut him some slack and celebrate a great book that has not been afraid to show us another [darker] side to this wonderful world of spells and magic. Lets also not forget, that if every one of the 7 books showed Harry & Co. skipping around like a nuns on a hill top every time somthing happened, the final conclusion would be leave the reader unable to genuinely feel anything is at stake, and that all the characters have made it through to the end having not made any effort or suffered any hardship at all.....The book is just as rich as its predecessors and continues to make you wish you were a pupil at Hogwarts and a seeker on the Griffindor Quidditch team!",FALSE,2003,1531

The dementors made me terrified (imagine, no good  thoughts, no happy memories!) and the description of the Grim is  particularly vivid.  And the exerpts from the Potters' deaths--I actually  cried!  It seemed incredibly awful for Harry to have to hear that.  The  ending was superb, if a little suprising (I would have perferred more  foreshadowing), and Harry comes through as always.  It will be interesting  to see how Sirus Black figures in the next books.  I'm fifteen, and my guy  friend said I NEEDED to read these books--rated them on a par with The  Golden Compass and The Lord of the Rings.

Ms. Rowling, you have done a marvelous job  creating a book that children can read without corruption (despite jealous  reports to the contrary) and older readers can get so much more from.  Matt  and I are now sharing our books with the entire school (9-12), our English  teacher is devouring them, and Harry is a hot topic at the lunch table.

Just like any other typical adolescent.  This Harry is growing up and learning to see everything and everyone he knows through adult eyes.Although the book is quite long, it doesn't seem to sag or slow down anywhere.

Rowling puts Harry and the Hogwarts gang into almost inescapable situations.  I knew that Harry would get out of them (after all, there are two more books), but I had no idea how.  There is a death in the book.  Rowling has mentioned this in past interviews.  Although this death was not as surprising as it could have been, it makes Harry an even more tragic figure than he already was.This book seems much more thought out than ""The Goblet of Fire"".  There are clues and situations throughout the book that actually lead towards the ending of the book and beyond to the next two books.  Congratulations to Ms. Rowling for an excellent job.

So, there is no doubt in my mind that the book doesn't have to be as long as it is.  But one thing that I do love about the book is that it is written more towards adults this time.  There are situations that little kids will never understand or relate to, such as going before a judge in a trial.  I think the book is darker than the others but that is partly what makes it even more for adults.  Yes, adults will probably need to read this book aloud to some young adults.

Since the end of the last book when Harry escaped death in such a heroic way, the wizard newspaper has turned his story into him being the opposite of a hero, making fun of him and somewhat making him seem as an enemy himself. The Ministry of Magic knows Voldermort is back but doesn't want to put it out to the people so they won't panic. They also intrude in Hogwarts, putting a Ministry of Magic representative as teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Ms. Umbridge. After some time goes by, they turn her into the High Inquisitor, taking Dumbledore's position. She always gives Harry a hard time. Harry's 5th adventure, with him having to worry about so much since its his 5th year at Hogwarts, having to take exams, knowing the man who killed his parents is free, experiencing love, and as always taking risks, could be known as the most promising so far.

Someone I would love to hate).The story started off quite slowly and tended to plod in between choice action scenes (my 13yr old sister who finished the book the day after, described it as ""boring"" ).The dialogue wasnt very original either. I soon got sick of hearing people say ..""because Dumbledore told us not to..""The cliffhanger finale was a bit short of surprising... if I really thought about it, I think I could have guessed the ending and figured out Dumbledore's ""revelations"" too.There were however, some truly enjoyable moments, like the teachers' reaction when Umbridge was made headmistress, and the Weasley twins' dramatic exit.Overall it was enjoyable to read, although not on the same calibre as the rest of the books.",FALSE,2003,1471

Rowling has once again brilliantly conceived an intricate story, wrought full of action, heroics, heartbreak, and adolescent woes.  The story is more detailed; more characters are introduced into the complex tapestry of Harry's world.  The borders of the story are extended beyond Hogwarts and Privet Drive, taking Harry to several points in London, including the Ministry of Magic and St. Mungo's among others.The book reads quickly, as the previous 4 do.  There exist more prevalent tones of discord and rebellion associated coming of age through the turbulent mid-teenage years, as Harry and friends are now 15.  There is a much more dark side of Harry exposed, as he feels somewhat treated still like a kid, even though he has experienced much in the hands of evil.  Throughout, he often has very negative feelings towards all around him, and alienates himself from those who he loves most.The ending is brilliant, and more is revealed about Harry...questions are answered that have plagued readers since the Sorcerer's Stone.  This book, to its strength, also lets Harry know that all those around him, those he has placed on high pedestals since the magical world was revealed to him, are not perfect, but human.J.K.

I am looking forward to her next novel in this series.At the end of his fourth year, Harry Potter had seen one of his friends die at the hands of the Dark Lord, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, otherwise known as Lord Voldemort, who also took the lives of his parents.

As he had not heard anything from the Muggle news, he seems relieved and a bit happy that the Dark Lord has not yet returned to his evil ways. But he could not have been more wrong. Dementors attack him and his cousin, he nearly gets expelled (again), and none of his friends have told him any information about the Dark Lord from the wizarding world. He gets extremely frustrated that he cannot be in the wizarding world to help the prevention of the Dark Lord from coming back. However, he gets quite a suprise. Want to know more? Read the book! This book is extremely satisfying, and is a great collection to your bookshelf along with the other Harry Potter books. Enjoy!",FALSE,2003,1471

The fourth would be the best if not for this gem here....There are some new characters, ones that will surely be a factor in the upcoming books. Lupin, a character I really like, is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA for short) teacher. Cho Chang is a girl 1 year older than Harry, and is steadily getting his attention. Cedric Diggory is the clean-cut, handsome, do-gooder than Harry and his friends don't like. And of course, Sirius Black is the traitor of Harry's parents, and fugitive from Azkaban.Harry Potter is finally becoming a great novel, and after this book, few people will truly think this is a kid's book. It's a novel for everybody with elements that every kid fanatasizes about when they're a kid. That's why adults love it. They remember the times when they wish they could cast magic, live in a big castle with very interesting things with their best friends....Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - the book that'll become known as the one that took Harry Potter out of kidland and put it among the greatest series of books in literature.

I personally felt that the fourth book was the best.  With the Triwizard Tournament, that book was very exciting and interesting.  It left you with deep suspense until the end.  I felt that this fifth book, the Order of the Phoenix, was a little dragging, and the ending was a little disappointing. I feel that maybe this book was too long, which is why it felt like it was dragging a lot when you were reading it.  Though still, I couldn't take my eyes off reading it because J.K Rowling has a great way of taking you into the book and keeping you excited and in suspense.  I do not regret reading this book.  I feel that even though it might not have been as great as the other four, it was still a wonderful book and well worth the time to read.

I will not spiol the book for others, except to say that the summer goes on even longer than in the last book, and that Rowling really gave very little away when she said that someone important would die. indeed, at a number of points, it seemed as if most of the characters were in mortal peril with no escape. Rowling introduces a number of new characters in this novel, but old characters get their due as well: some who had only bit parts in earlier books have, at least, speaking parts in this one. this adds a certain class to the novel, as it shows that Rowling has forgotten nothing that she has written in the past, a crime which most fantasy and childrens authors are guilty of. <...",FALSE,2003,1467

And all the reviewers were talking about how great it was that Harry was showing signs of adolescence and moodiness.  I just found the mood swings and spurts of temper very repetitive, tiring.

Maybe Witchy could even sit beside Harry Potter on the  home library shelf. That would be the greatest thrill to sit beside someone  as famous as Harry Potter. Harry Potter is famous but down to earth and he  has a good spirit.  Witchy has a good spirit, too, and keeps trying until  she succeeds.  Characters like Harry Potter make great friends.

The Order of The Phoenix is a group of wizards who try and defeat Lord Voldemort.I liked when Harry was able to spend time with his godfather Sirius Black.

I am hoping that this death will somehow make more sense later in the series.In reply to someone's comment about the death and the time turner, Buckbeak wasn't really brought back from the dead in the Third Harry Potter book, he never died in the first place, Harry and friends only thought that he did because they heard the thud of the axe and Hagrid crying. Read the book again to notice this. Also one of the conclusions of the third book is that time is too complicated to keep turning back, if they used a time turner to bring the person back from the dead many other things could have happened, maybe even other people would have died.I advise everyone to read this book and notice the small details as they are just as important and significant as the story with Lord Voldemort.",FALSE,2003,1466

No longer a boy, he is a rebellious, moody teen whose hormones often land him in trouble (especially with the malevolent new villian the author has conjured up). It follows the same structure the previous novels have done, but provides a variety of new turns to the story, allowing the reader to think hard on what has just happened after they finish the book.

I thought I would never be able to finish the book when I first opened it up and saw how many pages it was.  The chapters are 20-25 pages long each.  And there is almost 40 chapters.  I felt the book would never end when I started reading it.  It seemed like the more pages I read, the more pages there were to read.But J.K. Rowling is an incredible author who keeps you yearning for more.  I would start reading just to finish one chapter, and I would end up reading 2 or 3 at a time.  The story does not drag on.  It never gets off topic.  And there is always a suspenseful moment in every chapter to keep you lured in.This story was confusing in the beginning of the book and left a lot of loose ends until I got toward the end of the book.  Then, I began to realize everything that was going on.  This book is not only centered around Harry's mischievous acts.  It also tells of his troubles with love.  He feels like he is isolated from the world and everyone is out to get him.  He feels confused when he sees things but he doesn't know why.  The staff is acting differently toward him, especially Dumbledore.

While Harry ended as a hero and conquerer in the Goblet of Fire, he is now dragged through the mud and his findings discredited.  Finally at the end of the book he is brought back into good light and the book ends in almost the same situation as the fourth book.  The book does give useful insight into the plot of the series and does have a strong emotional tug.  Although Harry seems to be miserable the whole book, however mood swings are expected as Harry grows through his teenage years.  Don't expect the same level of activity as GoF, with the Triwizard tournament and all, and don't expect the same entangling plot developement like in the last few books that leads you through the scenes and places but leaves the ultimate explanation to the end of the book where it all fits together and leaves you thinking about how everything tied in.  I believe that was the only lamentable drawback because the plot didn't have the huge suprises at the end, it was generally a maturing book for Harry (and a rough one).  I recommend the book to anyone reading the Harry Potter series because it deepens the plot greatly and is a very good read, just expect a different kind of book than the Goblet of Fire.",FALSE,2003,1469

As each of the 3 books seemed to be unique, and the 4th was kinda linked alot with the 2nd, i was wonderin what this one would be like.  Turns out this one was like a summary of all the previous ones.  It had all the old charactors(Harry, Ron, Hermione, of course, and also Cho, Sirius, all of the weaslys), a couple of returns like with Lupin and Moody, and tons of new important charactors.  The story is your classic HP story, mixed in with the stress of being 15 years old.  This book has romance(boring)and fights and, of course, plenty of secrets and clues, and action.  It seems now that their struggling with OWL's, the Ministry, Voldermort, and, for the first time, with each other, meaning all of the hogwarts students and the members of the Order of the Pheonix.

"5779",5,732230,FALSE,"I just finished this book recently and I must say it was amazing and is by far the best entry to the amazing Harry Potter series. I would like to address what some consider to be bad about this book such as the fact that there isn't a lot of action. This comment is very true as Order of the Phoenix is nowhere near as close as Goblet of Fire in the action department, but the fact of the matter is Order of the Phoenix focuses on plot and character development. While book 4 had a lot of action none of it was really important to the overall story, except for the end at the cemetary. Book 5 puts a lot of emphasis on developing Harry as he grows up and his hormones begin to change and he learns about love, as well as learning how to deal with the fact that Lord Voldemort is back. Almost every character is developed more in this book including Snape which is probably my favorite part in the book. The plot really gets inrested when you see the Ministry of Magic treat Harry very unfairly because they don't want to believe Voldemort is back, and they even go as far as trying to take over Hogwarts and prevent students from learning how to defend against dark arts through the appointed Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher Dolores Umbridge who goes all out to make Harry's life miserable. The Ministry of Magic then writes articles about Harry trying to make him look crazy and basically turns most of the student body against Harry. Little things about the plot are done well such as showing why Neville lives with his Grandmother and why Professor Trelawney is really at Hogwarts. The book also capitalizes with a huge battle at the Ministry of Magic which is very exciting. Another big issue is people complain about Harry's attitude. Okay well yeah you might get annoyed with this if you really don't understand the situation. Harry is only 15 years old, he is just a young boy he isn't a grown man so don't expect him to act like one. In Harry's 15 year life, he has gone through things most people never have to go through in their entire life. To give you an idea of what Harry is going through at this point I will list some of the things: he was orphaned at the young age of 1 and now the man who murdered his parents is back, and to top it off only a handful of people believe him and many including the government are trying to turn everyone aganinst him. To top it off the people who support him are keeping a lot of information from him and this can frustrate anyone. Harry just wants to be a normal person and live a normal life like anyone else, but he can't and all this tension that has been building up in him since going to Hogwarts is all coming out now. Harry also learns to deal with things every person goes through, which is puberty and his hormones changing which can cause any boy to have a temper and then he also learns the pain of love when him and Cho Chang have a short relationship that goes very sour. Basically everyone should give this book a chance, it is a great book as well as a great entry in the great Harry Potter series. I hope my review helped all of you who didn't like the book originally and those who are wondering if they should read this. If you didn't like this book when you first read it I highly recommend you read it again and instead of seeing things as pointless details pay attention to them and this will help you to enjoy and appreciate the overall story much more.

I had promised myself after the three-year wait that I would savor this fifth installment slowly, but I swear someone Transfigured my copy into that book Ron mentioned in The Chamber of Secrets, the one that a wizard could never stop reading. The pages just flew by.J.K. Rowling outdid herself with the Order of the Phoenix. The characterizations are amazingly well done.

He matures throughout the book - the skinny little boy with bright green eyes becomes a teenager who knows more about the darker side of life than anyone his age should. The famous Gryffindor bravery and temper are still present, though, so as readers we are treated to numerous bouts of rule-breaking. While unquestionably darker than its precedessors, the book is still full of Rowling's wonderful sense of humor. I was nearly rolling on the ground with laughter after reading some of the pranks of the infamous duo Fred and George - long live Weasley's Wizard Wheezes!Anyone who has not yet bought this book should do so NOW.

I thought GF should have been edited better and the editors were doing her a disservice, i.e. letting a writer who is in love with her story overwrite it.  However, having just finished OP, I must say that the pace in this one is much quicker, and the variety of new settings keeps you moving right through the book, avoiding for the most part that ""dull center"" at the middle of long books when you sometimes wonder if it's worth continuing with a 500+ page novel.  With OP, you are too busy turning pages to even notice how long the book is!  It gives adult readers that old childhood pleasure of looking up at the clock and not believing how much time has gone by, and that wonderful old sensation of not wanting to do *any*thing other than keep reading right then and there--skipping meals, staying up till the wee hours of the night!  What fun for those adults who can block out a day or a weekend and relish that kind of pleasure again.Rowling took more time with this one than GF, and it shows.

Like other faithful fans, I groaned each time the release date of book 5 was pushed back.  After finishing the book just one hour ago, I am pleased to say, It was worth the wait.  I would say this book takes a big departure from the other novels in terms of mood and sentiment.  The novel has an almost claustrophobic feel because it is in part, so tense, and so very hinged on Harry's ultra-violent teenage moodswings.  I won't give anything away to those that haven't read it, but Harry is definitely growing up.  More than ever, in this installment of the series, we find him to be definitely flawed, even arrogant at times.  However, as a hero, this makes him more believable, and even easier to relate to.  Besides, he does finally come back down to earth.  The plot is top-notch, as is to be expected.  All the old characters have returned, some, one in particular, really turns out to be a rotten apple!  There are some great new characters as well.  In conclusion, the book is great.  Don't be put off by the size, if you liked Goblet of Fire, this one will go even faster, despite a beginning that for me, seemed a little hard to get into.  J.K.

While certain elements are necessary additions to keep the series progressing, Rowling could have afforded the same or near the same amount of lightheartedness that the other books afforded.What I liked:--Ron Weasley: Finally, some long overdue glory!  I was tickled to read that he was selected as a prefect and overjoyed when he took Gryffindor to it's second straight Quidditch Cup--Hermione Granger: As clever, haughty and eccentric as always, this was a welcome dose of familiarity--Ginny Weasley: Look out!  She's growing up and I wouldn't be surprised if the infatuation tables were turned on the Boy Who Lived himself.--The Weasley Twins: Always my favorite characters, I was delighted with their most recent series of antics and laughed until I cried at their dramatic escape from HogwartsWhat I Didn't Like:--Harry:While the break from the overdone heroics was more than welcome, Harry's bitter attitude and anger, though understandable, became tiresome after the first several chapters.--Dolores Umbridge: A witch in every sense of the word, this conniving, scheming, unscrupulous new professor made me want to leap into the pages and take her own broomstick to her backside.--Cho Chang: A blubbering, pitiful mess of turbulent emotion, she went from mildly likeable in the previous book to just flat irritating in this one.  Overall, I found this book to be too dark and depressing to read again.  I also do not personally feel that this book is appropriate for readers under the age of fourteen or perhaps fifteen.

Rage dwells within him that was never quite to this calibur in any of the parts of the series. He is soon sent off from the Dursley's to a very unlikely place where he meets old and new companions. But the adventure has yet begun. Voldemort has seized power once again has stated in The Goblet of Fire, but no one believes Harry Potter or Albus Dumbledore. From there it is a constant battle between the Ministry of Magic and a few believers. Harry experiences jelousy, fear, rage, compassion, deep rooted hatred, confusion, happiness, and such heartwrenching sadness as he has never felt before. This book will keep you glued to the book until the very last word. At times it feels as you can actually connect with the feellings of Harry, thought to be both mad and a liar. At times, Hogwarts may be worse than the Dursley's place. Every aspect that has made Hogwarts so enjoyable for Harry will be wrenched away from him.

Order of the Phoenix is much darker and more serious than the others proceeding it; it's Harry's most frustrating and toughest school year yet, but author JK Rowling's sharp humor keeps things from getting too heavy.  Some of the more one-dimensional characters like Professor Snape and Percy Weasley are fleshed-out giving us a richer and more complex view into Harry's world.  JK's depiction of Harry and Sirius Black proves that heroes can still be heroes even with a few flaws and warts.My beloved character Lupin is back (albeit in a smaller role) and new quirky characters Tonks and Luna Lovegood hark back to the delightful fun-filled early years of Harry Potter.

Though one thing about Harry has got my attention through out this book he seems to be coming a little more darker, meaning his anger and temper are wild. But I seriously like the change though he needs to control it more often, it should that he is not the 11 year old boy that we first started out with, he has girl troubles, teacher troubles as a new defense against the dark arts teacher comes into the picture, friend troubles, and family troubles, he has quite the time getting through all.

I admit, some might have preferred the same tone and structure of books 1-3 to continue all the way down the line to book 7, but I guess Rowling decided that incorporating the reality of growing up and evolving was the best thing to do, even if a bit uncomfortable and awkward at first. And I think she was right to do that.Sometimes it's a little frustrating to read details that aren't really relevant until the end of the book (or possibly until the end of the series), but it makes it worthwhile when everything fits together in that ""ohhh, that makes sense"" moment. And there's no letdown; the book is full of clever twists, originality, and real wit.Not to mention, I've found many more humorous moments in this book. There were parts that made me laugh out loud; Rowling does a great iob of painting funny scenes and appealing to the reader's sense of humor more than usual.It does a great ob of immersing you into the Hogwarts world, especially because there is so much detail.

More truth about Harry's past makes his life  itself seem ever more mysterious (and from the number of reviews, here, a  lot of people like mysteries!)

He begins to learn, fully and truly, that his destiny is not in anyone's hands but his own, that he is not completely safe with anyone and if he wishes to remain alive, he must make a terrible choice- not easy for anyone to go through at any point, but especially difficult at the age he is at. He suffers through the miseries of a doomed crush, a tragic loss of a great friend, and the realization that his father may not have been the most wonderful person to have ever existed, at least, not when his father was a teen.Not only that, but the idiocy of the Ministry of Magic brings even more peril to the school in the form of Delores Umbridge, who will probably go down in Hogwarts history as the most despicable teacher ever to disgrace the hallways, and further disrupting Harry's trust in adult authority.

Every single character has returned, new memories are reveled, new plot lines unravel in every chapter, characters fall in and out of love at the turn of a page-- it's hormones and despair, joy and sorrow, frustration and unbelieveable suspense at everywhere you look.But, remarkably, nothing has changed. Harry, while considerably more angry (as is obvious in the first few pages) is still the hero of our 7 part epic, brave and courageous; Ron, the lanky, red haired side kick is as loveable as ever with a few surprises up his sleeve; and Hermione is still as studious as can be, making sure that nothing can happen without her and her abounding knowledge of everything.In short, if you don't read this book, or the series at all, you're missing out on one of the greatest literary achievments of all time!!(By the way, I made sure that I made this book last and actually spanned it for a whole 15 days.

A slew of new and familiar faces enter the fold, including some terrificly horrible new characters, and some unexpected behavior from old favorites.It's a long book, so be warned: There are some slow spots, but the driving power of the plot keeps the pages turning. Rowling's narrative form has grown by leaps and bounds in this novel. Her vocabulary ages along with her readers, and I'd rate this book at least at a 5th- or 6th-grade reading level. Even then a dictionary close at hand would help. Her powers of storytelling are as strong as ever, and her descriptions are sparkling, creating scenes and characters that aren't likely to disappear from imaginations -- young or old -- anytime soon.Some material in the book may be too strong for young readers. There is some violence and mild adult language is spattered throughout.

That hasn't diminished in this book.The tone of volume five is far, far darker than any of the other books. Those expecting a neat, clear resolution at the end of the book will find themselves either surprised or disappointed.We meet a few new characters, some likable, some decidedly not. Some existing characters are also fleshed out and developed, and of course, we lose one of our main characters. (Did you actually think I was going to tell you who?) The death of that character was one of the few disappointments I found in the book. It happens so quickly and ambiguously that I didn't find myself reacting to it emotionally much at all.

I feel Rowling did a good job at protraying the adults around him as human; they have their own problems that prevent them from recognizing and supporting his as fully as you could wish, but she may have gone overboard on Harry's hair trigger negative emotions. His personality shift seemed a bit too abrupt. Thank goodness for Hermione, but she seems a bit too wise beyond her years at times.If Rowling is trying to illustrate the confusion, embarrassment and sense of outraged justice (""that's not fair!"") that teenagers feel, she's probably doing a good job. I'm just concerned that she hasnt shown the benefits of asking for help or at least clarification from a sympathetic older person.  Knowing others feel as you do probably helps kids, but knowing that you can take steps to make it better would help them more.  Wish I had learned this as a teen...Right.

Supposedly a murderer of thirteen people, Sirius Black has escaped from  Azkaban, the highest security jail in the country, and is to be believed to  be after Harry. Dementors, jail guards from the prison, are out everywhere,  even at Harry's school. They suck the life and happiness out of any place  they occupy, and Harry is petrified of them. Anytime he sees one he can  hear his parents dying, what a lovely thought. There is tension between  Harry, Ron and Hermoine, Harry's friends. Hermoine is trying to do too much  work, she has two classes at the same time, making her a little bit tired  and grumpy. The new cat she got, which definitely creates tension between  her and Ron, tries to eat Ron's pride and joy Scabbers, a very old and  frail mouse. Ron stops talking to her and she becomes very lonely. The  climax is when Sirius Black sneaks into the school and lures the friends to  the shrieking shack, a haunted house connected to the school by an  underground tunnel. It was a pretty exciting climax. I thought Rowling  could have spiced it up a bit, but maybe that's just me. All the conflicts  and mysteries of the book are interestingly and cleverly woven together to  create a finished product. And a very good one I might add! My favorite  part of the book is when Professor Lupin and Sirius Black are about to kill  Peter Pettigrew, yet Harry nobly protests and explains."" We'll take  him up to the castle. We'll hand him over to the Dementors.... He can go to  Azkaban...but don't kill him."" Harry shows alot of integrity here,  even though he would probably rather love to see Pettigrew die; he makes  the right decision. I think the theme of this book is overcoming your  fears. Harry has to do this all throughout the book. He had to learn how to  perform a patronus, a very advanced spell which castes away Dementors.  "" A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak.  His Patronus flickered and died. White fog was blinding him. He had to  fight..."" Here Harry is being surrounded by Dementors, naturally,  Harry is scared, yet he faces his fears and pulls through. This probably  wasn't my most favorite of the Rowling books, yet it was certainly  gripping, suspenseful, and interesting.

But his fifth year embarks on a journey that is darker than the previous adventures, bringing with it all of the symptoms of adolescence at the same time.

We know Harry and Voldemort are connected; we know that Harry and he are equals in power. This is the only reason why Voldemort wants to kill Harry though?? I expected there to be something more telling and complex. I feel as if J.K. Rowling left the writing of the explanation to a 4th grade reader who has no concept of plot formation. The saving moments of the book, are the depictions of Harry becoming a full fledged moody, arrogant teenager, leaving behind some of the tween-Indiana Jones-esque hero perfection he had displayed before. Some people were annoyed with Harry's behavior, but I think this is a brilliant display of the depth of character development Rowling invests in Harry. It is really too bad though, that this is the sole outlet Rowling gave any effort to.

Specifically, I'm talking about plot.  One reviewer complained about how the house-cleaning and Hagrid's brother didn't add to the plot.  Well, I happen to agree with Stephen King on this point: he distrusts plot because our lives are largely plotless, and any story which is worth telling is about someone's life.  What he prefers is to put characters in a situation and see what happens.  He says ""Plot is, I think, the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice.  The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.""  The Order of the Phoenix did not feel artificial and labored, it was very gripping and compelling.  A lot happened in this book, whatever some people like to think.  I'd say this book was in a large part about character development, if there was any ""about"" to it.  A lot of character development did take place in here:  Harry discovered hormones (anyone who says he wasn't acting like himself has never gone through puberty - and that coupled with his entire world hating him for telling the truth and a teacher on his case who made Voldemort look like the Easter bunny, among many other things, it's a testimony to his strength of character that he didn't ultimately snap!), Hagrid has a brother (a VERY interesting character development, and for all you plot-naggers, he did save Harry's hide, and maybe he'll be important later on, you never know), Dumbledore is only 99.99% infallible after all, the rest of the world finally catches up to Harry on the presence of Voldemort, a main character dies, which is certainly going to throw him for even more of a loop than the death of Diggory in front of him, and he finds out that his own father wasn't always the saint he had thought him to be, but was a real person as well!

Too dark and Not suitable for children- I think this is nonsense. Yes Harry's dating and going through pubertiy. Get over it.

The Order of the Phoenix is trying to protect Harry and put a stop to Volemort's plans in spite of the obstacles raised by the Ministry.As far as Harry's anger and behavior, stop and think:  A few weeks before page 1 of Book 5 he witnessed the senseless murder of a peer and was nearly murdered himself.  That would be traumatic enough to send an adult reeling, much less a 15 year old.  Then in the following weeks he is extremely frustrated by a lack of information from the wizarding world about the whereabouts and actions of the man who tried to kill him.  No wonder the kid is upset.Yes, this book was darker, and the death of a significant character was sad, but it is a natural progresssion of the overall story.  I was not disappointed.  I was touched by the scene with Neville and his parents, and got a kick out of Gilderoy Lockhart's cameo.

I feel that I can relate to how Harry feels because it wasn't that long ago that I was 15...and I didn't have the added stress of having to save the world while I was figuring out relationships! It was also great finally seeing some of Dumbledore's power in relation to the other wizards.  I mean, we've heard how powerful he is, but now we actually have proof! We also get to see his more human side.  The fight at the end was great, and I was surprised by who Mrs Rowling decided to kill.  Towards the end of the book I was also rather surprised and felt even more sorry for Harry. (But I wont be a spoiler.  Read the book if you want to find out! *grin*) As I got to the last page, the only thing I could think of was ""I can't wait until the next one""!

There is some anger and hurt as bad things start to happen, and you feel his frustration as he starts to  question why his life has been turned upside down through the first 4 books.  Great new characters are introduced, and are welcomed into the storyline with no awkward-ness at all.

To start my overall view on the book, I'd have to say firstly, that the plot twists and turns were unexpected and surprising.

Instead she once again produces a book that is breathtaking in it's depth and imagination and brings us deep into that wonderful Wizardary world that we don't want to leave.I've decided the plot isn't really that important. Obviously Harry mingles with Voldermore again. Obviously he is victorious, sort of. What is important to me and what makes the books so addicting is the world the JK Rawling creates and lets us inhabit with Harry. A world with invisible horses, magic wands, talking pictures, evil Wizards, pink-haired witches. A world that is brilliant in it's imagination and one that while not entirely bright and friendly is nonetheless, exciting and always surprising - one that we would all love to visit.This book did not disappoint at all.

Unlike in other books where the hero makes no mistakes, and even if they do they always turn out right anyway, J.K Rowling makes her characters so much more believable.  Harry makes mistakes and he has to live with the results of them.  All the books are great for their suspense and mystery, but The Order of the Phoenix should recieve an O for outstanding on its O.W.L for the emotions that all of the characters (and the reader) go through.

The title of this book is very bad, and is prolly one of the worst names Rowling could have given it.  Even ""Harry Potter 5"" is a better name.  You will understand once you have read it.

The new characters were cute, and the ""death"" wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and overall it's definitely worth a read, if for nothing else than to have something to talk about to your sons and daughter.

Rowling is an amazing writer that makes you feel the suspense in a story.The reason I like this book is because of how well J.K. Rowling describes the characters of Ron, Harry, and Hermione.  Sometimes I think of myself as Hermione because we both have brown, frizzy hair and always study.  J.K. Rowling makes Malfoy seem so evil and rueful, yet Harry is never indignant.  In this book, there are many twists and turns, especially something that you would never think about, but I will not give it away.  You'll just have to read it yourself.  Another thing is that Hagrid becomes a teacher at Hogwarts, instead of being a custodian.  But, as always, Malfoy finds a way to mess things up.  My least favorite character is Malfoy because all of the evil things he does to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  I think that my favorite character in this book is probably Sirius Black, a mad killer that broke out of Azkaban.  Also, you find many surprises through Sirius Black and his acquaintances.  Lastly, something that brought a tear to my eye is that Griffindor won the Quidditch cup because of Harry.  I am very excited to see what is up next in the future of Harry Potter.",FALSE,2005,2243

She writes like there is a magical world and that she attended Hogwarts.The fifth book was so heavily anticipated that it kind of let me down when i was half-way through. But then I appreciated it more towards the end-and it brought the whole book together.We all know someone dies in this novel-and i actually cried when this person did. This person was my favorite character in any book I've ever read (next to Scarlett O'Hara) and it made me furious that JK Rowling would do something like this-but death happens, and I'm sure she had her reasons, hopefully this person's death will be a start to something great in one of her next books.Most people out there say they aren't into ""that sorta thing"" or they think they're too old, i am definately not a little kid, and i am definately not into fantasy, this book is so realy that you swear you can walk through the wall between platforms 9 and 10 at Kings Cross Station and be on your way to Hogwarts.Trust me-this is a great book-just try it!",FALSE,2003,1470

First of all I'd like to start with a confession. I really didn't like the first half of the book and got so disappointed of the things happening in the muggle world and what happened before the King's Cross. But somehow I forced myself to read because I had a feeling that this couldn't be it! So I read and read and then as all the readers, and also Harry himself, found out something extraordinarily huge! I won't make any comments on this enourmous information Harry was given by Dumbledore for the people who hasn't read the book yet.Through the end of the book, I realized that J.K. Rowling has done a really good job explaning the emotions of a teenager, the emotions people get caught in when they lose someone so important for themselves and the feelings of disappointment for the people they had praised for years.As I'm ending this review I'd like to say that though this book was totally different from the other 4, it wasn't lacking any adventure nor shocking events.

From centaurs to giants, Defense Against Dark Arts (hem, hem) to Occlumency, quidditch surprises and spew , sorry S-P-E-W, Harryy's first kiss and crush to betrayal and loyalty, this is Harry's coming of a ge book. The authouress (world's most fantastic!) has very successfully managed to deliver Harry's frustration, irritation at disbelief from all corners. Pain at the loss of someone dear leaves Harry broken and leads to the explanation of practically everything-- Dumbledore's ignoring Harry, his choice of prefects, his retaining Trewlawney for so many years, and most importantly, the mystery behind his scar. Neville  and Ginny play slightly more promimnent roles (not together though) and there is also the introduction of several new characters like the REAL Moody, Nymphadora Tonks and other members of the Order.

Ms. Rowling allows us to experience even more of her complex young wizard and his seemingly innumerable struggles and predicaments.  Harry is now 15, and not only must he deal with the trials of ordinary adolescent angst, such as girls, school, and asserting his independence, but the Dark Lord is back more than ever before and presents Harry with more challenges than most ordinary adult wizards could successfully handle.  We gain insights into what the future may hold for Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and the rest of the Hogwarts gang, as well as a better understanding of Harry's complex past.  I found this volume much easier to understand and follow than the fourth volume, probably due to the extra time the author allowed herself when writing.  The younger J.K. Rowling fans will no doubt share in this opinion; though my son enjoyed Year 4, parts of it, especially those dealing with the Dark Lord, were difficult for him to understand.  I do not anticipate that being a problem for him at all this time.

It is a good solid continuation of the lives of wizards and witches so many of readers have become familiar with and attached to.  The personalities of the all the characters take on a more three-dimensional quality.  Yes, Harry is much more moody, but that comes with the age, not to mention the added pressures.  While we find out more about Harry's past and family through this book, what is even more fascinating is the development of the other characters in Hogwarts (and not just Ron and Hermione). I have guesses as to what complicated relationships might develop within Harry's group, but I won't include any spoilers here.Perhaps the book is slightly darker than the last, but I believe the pre-teen age group would still be hooked (not to mention adults - I know more than a few people).  Although strictly speaking I might have to give the book 4.5 stars.  The middle section drags on just a bit, but the fast pace of the first and last 200 pages keeps readers interested.  I inhaled the pages at night (way too late, of course), and found myself hoping for more at the end.  The moment I finished the book I was ready for the sixth book.

For example, Harry has an extremely short temper with everyone in his life: the Dursleys', his best friends, even his school headmaster. I was a bit surprised at his change of attitude seeing as he used to be pretty easy-going. Nevertheless, Rowling did point out that Harry is going through adolesence, not to mention the tragedy from the end of his fourth year.This year, Hogwarts is in chaos after Harry and Dumbledore cause fright and disbelief of their story of Voldemort's return. The Ministry of Magic chooses to interfere with everyone and everything associating with Dumbledore, including all of the school's affairs.The story deepens and darkens in the shadow of Voldemort's return making this book quite engrossing. Readers are introduced to many new characters involved in watching Voldemort's moves. Some of the old characters have a different side of them shown; Ginny Weasley matures from the scared easily-frightened girl she used to be. She actually becomes quite likeable. Also, Harry finds another reason of Snape's hatred for him which thoroughly shakens himself.I must admit that this book kept my eyes glued to it.

Now i'm just depressed because I have never had to experience waiting for a Harry Potter book to come out before. This book was definately darker than the previous ones and I don't know what people expected. Of course the tone of the books have to change as Harry grows older. It can't be all happy-go-lucky and mostly cheerful as the first books were. Harry is not 11 anymore. As Harry grows older, he has to face more serious issues. He is also a growing teenager and his mood swings are definately realistic to a teenager.Now comes the depressing part. I am still in tears over the death of one of the characters. This was one of my favorite characters and when I learned that someone dies in the fifth book I hoped and prayed that it wouldn't be the character who in fact does die. I finished this book at 4:30 in the morning and just sat there crying. I can't wait until the sixth book comes out.

The action was slow (actually, there's not much action come to think of it), there were few funny lines, it didn't have a lot of new interesting magical stuff like in the other books, and there were very few surprises.  Harry also seemed to be not his usual brave, generous, and kind self here... he was most of the time confused, angry, reckless, and a bit selfish :(  Still, I'll be waiting for Book 6...

This year, he is discredited by the Ministry and the Media, neither of which will accept the truth, and the school is passed to a new headmaster. Those who fought for the common cause now find it is only the fight of the few who believe it, as most have turned their backs to the rising of the Dark Lord.At the same time, Harry gets his dream of winning Cho, only to find it may not be what he wanted.

You find yourself screaming when Harry and is  friends are in danger and cryng when shocking secrets are reveald and then  shaking as the supense builds up. You'll cheer along with the rest of the  school as Harry leads his Quidditch team to victory. You'll laugh along  when Ron's(Harry's bestfriend)twin brothers tell jokes. You'l be absolutely  amazed by all the strangle words such as  ""Dumbledore"",""Snape"",""muggles"",""mandrakes"",and""hippogriph"".  These books are very hard to put down.

The book delivers non-stop action, but this time without the comedy and cheerful flippancy that the precursors to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had. Instead the story has realistic undertones that set the mood of the book very well: the readers should not fool themselves into thinking that Phoenix will be another light-hearted tale of Harry Potter and his friends and their adventures in the magical world. Rather, they should prepare for incredible plot twists and gasp-inducing cliffhangers.

I was a bit disappointed, however, that what advice it gave wasn't followed, so I'm hoping that it's a foreshadowing of the storylines to follow in the next two books.

Harry is also getting visions in his sleep that are greatly disturbing him, but that he also finds intriguing and wants to understand.

Plus, it was substantially longer than the others, which  I was very happy about.  One of my favorite parts of ""Harry Potter  and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was when Harry learned more about his  past.  He learns a little more in each book, but after completing the third  book he knew a great deal about his parents.  This book also brought up  interesting magic, the most intriguing imaginative yet so far.

Long novels are great, but at times it seems as if Rowling is quite verbose.  For example - a reviewer said the opening sequence was quite short.  Hah!

For reference, you'd almost be finished with book 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) in the same amount of pages!Harry continues to mistrust Snape - and as usual, never thinks to go to Snape when he needs help.  What I still don't understand is, as usual, when Snape helps or saves Harry, Harry never apologizes to Snape for being mean, angry, etc. Teenager or not, for the kind of character Rowling has written Harry as, he should be a lot smarter when it comes to dealing with Snape: That includes recognizing him as a friend of Dumbledores and apologizing for always fighting with him.At any rate, it's a great book that is worth reading, but for the not-150%-Potter fans, this book might seem a slightly excessive in length.",FALSE,2003,1465

That's just not plausible, and there'd be a million more complaints if Rowling had kept up Harry's cheerful innocence through the entire series.

It was still magical, but for me the specialness was wearing off. Maybe it was all that time waiting for it to come out.  I read the first four voraciously, and felt like I was in that world and sympathized with Harry.The first half is a little boring.  Even with the explanation at the end, I still don't understand why Aunt Petunia all the sudden feels so obligated to keep Harry (because she knows otherwise he's in terrible danger) when she seemed ambivilent enough, and almost happy, that his parents died.  You'd think she'd prefer him in danger so she wouldn't have to suffer any more humiliations.  Who knows?  Maybe JK has more in store with her in the last two books.I liked Grimauld Place, but this book the ""surprises"" were too easy to spot.  My favorite part of reading the other books were the surprises-Voldemort living on the head of that first Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Wormtail being Ron's rat, Cedric dying.  I knew right off that Kreacher would be in on something evil and it was too obvious how and when.At school, JK introduced a delightful character in Umbridge.  I hope she'll be back in the last two books somewhere; she was really entertaining!  I also loved Loony Luna; another great character addition who I hope is back in the next books, Tonks magical ability is entertaining as well and I can just imagine it in a movie.Ron developed really well in this book, and Ginny also came out of her shell; but Harry and Hermione became really one-dimensional a lot of times.  I think Rawling is trying to make them more teenage, which explains Harry's anger and such, but his anger and Hermione's nagging seem over-the-top.  You just wanna slap them both at some points and say ""Snap out of it!""  the Cho/Harry subplot was boring, but the secret defense meetings were great.I really liked how Snape developed as well.  The look into his past gives more depth not only to him but all the characters who were around then.  However, I don't get how, if he's a reformed Death-Eater; why does he still like Draco and his cronies so much when he knows they're are confirmed Death-Eaters?  I know they're in the same house but it doesn't make sense; the scene at the end with him taking points from Harry I just didn't get; I can get his dislike of Harry but not his like of the others.Basically every character who hasn't died came back somewhere in this book.  It kind of seemed contrived, but I guess Rawling's got to set it up to use them all in the last two books.The climax starts off really shaky.  OK, fine, I buy that Umbridge would take Hermione's bait and go into the Dark Forest even though it seems unlikely (you'd think Umbridge would know the dangers there).  But this Harry just not listening to reason?  He's an idiot.  And it WAS his fault that someone died there.  A lot to delve into in the next book.I liked the whole climax-ministry sequence very much.  The department of mysteries was intriquing and I want to know what that arch Sirius fell into was exactly.  Belatrix looks like a character that could become interesting in the next books.  I think Rawling handled all the characters in the climax well and kept me captivated there more than any other part of the book.  I have to say I'm getting a little tired of the other characters being unable to help-out 1 by 1 until it's always just Harry left.  But, knowing from advance publicity that someone would die, Rawling did a good job of keeping you guessing as to who.Dumbledore's explanation at the end was absurd.  I loved his other end-of-book speeches; I hated this one.  The ""phrophecy"" was so lame; I wanted something earth-shattering and cryptic, instead I got that Harry or Lord Voldemort must die. Yawn.  Harry might not have known that, but most readers already did instinctively.  The only interesting part is that it might really be Neville in the end (though Dumbeldore doesn't think so).  Of course by book 7 I want it to be Harry who does the deed, but at least if neville did it it would be something unpredictable, and that was this books biggest weakness: predictability.The book was still interesting and I read happily, and better than lots of other books out there.  I don't mind it being long-the longer the better-as long as it's not boring.  But in my opinion this was the weakest book of the series so far.  Hopefully the next one will come out sooner and have more surprises that we haven't already figured out.",FALSE,2003,1469

The fighting and badgering between Ron and Hermione was interesting.  There were many questions that appeared and then were answered later on:  How was Hermione getting to all of her classes when many of them were held at the same time?  Would Gryffindor win the Quidditch cup?  Why was Lupin ill once a month, and why was his boggart in that particular shape?

Yes, I know that's typical for his age, but I'm not looking for reality in a Harry Potter book; I'm looking to escape reality.  Everyone seemed so two-dimensional in this story.

I'd listened to anti-Potter rhetoric for a while, but abstained from making an opinion until I could read the books with a fair and open mind.There is a wide gulf between just reading a book and being caught up in a new world. With every word, I loved finding out more and more about Harry Potter. His first foray into the wizarding world was thrilling! Serpents, prophecies, the mysteries surrounding his parents deaths and the scar kept me entranced with each book!But now, J.K. Rowling's style has matured with a fifteen year old Harry who exceeded my deepest hopes with Order of the Phoenix! He struggles with anger, frustrations from being protected and fights against the bias of the Ministry of Magic.At times, the pages just flew by as I laughed over extremely humorous situations and held my breath at terrifying encounters.And to leave you with one interesting thought...

Voldemort is both a physical and psychological menace.This volume is also much harder than its predecessors. The feelings are stronger, darker, and more angry;  the tone is more serious, less light-hearted.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione do not enjoy their year at Hogwarts as much because Voldemort has the gift of creating discord among friends and colleagues.  They have much more to worry about, especially with the appearance of Umbridge, who tortures students and the reader alike.

Harry lost both his parents when he was only one year old, murdered by the most feared wizard in the world, Lord Voledamort. Harry relized that he was a wizard when he was 11 years old. The reason that he didn't know that he is a wizard because the secret had been kept quiet by the Dursleys, whom was hoping that they can squeeze every bit of magical blood out og Harry. This secret was revealed to Harry when a letter sent from the wizarding school of Hogwarts. Harry's adventure then started from there. Harry had been in Hogwarts for 2 years now, and is attending it for the 3rd year. This book mentions the adventure that Harry experienced during his third school year: from a prisoner escaping from a magic prison to knowing one of his teacher is a werewolf. Harry's best friends, Ron and Hermione, were also with him through the dangerous and exciting monents that were happening in the school.This book did a very good job in describing the settings, characters, plots, conflicts, and other magical and unbelivable twists and turns that you can expect in a real magical school. Although this book is aimed towards childrens aging for 7 to 11 years old, the book is still enjoyable to everyone who has a wide imagination. Personally, I think that this book is really good, both in the context and the storyboard. The author, J.K. Rowling, first started the Harry Potter series when she scribbled some crazy notes, for a new book, on scraps of paper in a local cafe, and was then got the interests of some book publishers. The publishers then distributed the first book; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone, world-wide. The first book caught the world's interests, and later, it had became a world phenomenon.This book really caught my interest, and gave a special time everyday when I read it.

"5939",3,731190,FALSE,"I enjoyed the book, however, I found that the plethera of new characters coupled with the change of the standard formula for the plot was quite an abrupt changed.  Admittedly, I understand that perhaps Rowling was trying to show some of the interaction between Harry and Voldemort and their personality 'switching' however, there are moments within the book that I feel are untrue to the characters within.  Harry, Dumbledore, as well as Hermonie and Ron all seem to be a bit out of step.  One could attribute this to adolesence, however, they seem jumbled within a plethera of new characters, settings and situations.  Instead of excellent character development and a steady rise of plot, Rowling throws new people at us like baseballs hoping we'll catch them as they whizz by within the plot.  Harry is exceptionally unlikeable at times in the book and it is never sufficiently explained why he is acting the way he is acting.  Also, the 'death' in the book seems pointless (not to mention over-foreshadowed) except in contrast to poor Cedric in the last book.

The plots are more intricate and the characters more three dimensional. This book is also possibly the darkest of the series. I applaud Rowling for having the guts in today's world of sophmoric and stupid literature for youth to tackle issues and ideas that most authors and artists are too cowardly to deal with. Children are young, but they can handle alot more than we give them credit. Even as the series has gone one a lesser author might  tone things down in to make the books more palatable or easy to swallow to parents who disaproove of the book, but not Rowling.

After a 700 page build up to the meeting of Potter and Voldemort one would expect a grand finale, so to speak, but I found myself rather let down.  This much darker book seems instead to build up to the 6th book as not much action really seemed to take place.  This is a much more cognitively devoted plot with regards to the main character, Potter.  While the previous 4 books seem suitable for younger ages this book is much more intellectually complex, and as previously mentioned, dark, more suitable for older children who can understand a 'not-so-happy ending.'  Admittedly I found myself saddened after reading it but of course cannot wait for the next book (though sadly it might be another 2 years before that happens!).

"5946",3,731196,FALSE,"To my surprise, I felt only slightly sorrowful, almost removed, at the fact that Rowling killed off the only character who's kept us turning pages in the successively worse book 4 and book 5.  Indeed, the fanatic idolatry I've associated with this character has been reduced to a fine subtlety after reading The Order of the Phoenix.The truth is, the character himself has not changed much.  Subject to the same human weaknesses as all of us, he/she nevertheless remains the character with that unique, rough-edged tenderness that makes him/her so endearing.  In the way he/she loves, and in the way he/she hates, there is a tremulous voice that speaks persistently of passion; perhaps he/she belongs to a class, as Snape says, of those who ""wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves"" -- ""weak people.""  To the very end, I loved this character for what he/she is, what he/she's symbolized, and what might have been if situations were different.  Then why is it that I seem lacking of emotion at his/her tragic death? (I apologize for the irritating gender-neutrality, but, not spoilers here)The Goblet of Fire was grossly excused by your truly, simply because Rowling has reached such a height with Azhkaban that I refused to believe that she could achieve anything less.  GoF had the kind of set up that, had it not belonged to the Harry Potter series, I would not have tolerated.  But at least everyone stays in character in GoF, Harry has his eye on the big picture, Dumbledore's lair is a sancturary, and there is consistence amidst twists.  All, it seems, is lost in Order of the Phoenix.Harry, for example, begins to get on everybody's nerves.  Perhaps Rowling is trying portray the angst and uncertainty of the teenage years, but this characterization of Harry has made him highly unlikeable -- and almost a bore about whom to read.  He jumps to quick and often angry conclusions, he refuses to believe he could ever be wrong, and he thinks that everyone -- including his friends -- are all out to get him. The few Quidditch scenes that we do get in this book seem like the result of a strained effort to include the game in the story, furthermore, the post-Quidditch Weasley/Malfoy quarrels and hexes are exact replications of earlier excerpts.  Hermione's efforts in freeing the house elves are noble, yet impractical: she never learns that the elves have been refusing her kind offers.  Therefore the entire S.P.E.W. storyline remains in midair, unable to gain the readers' sympathy, yet not unfavorable enough to shun and criticize.  Dumbledore keeps his distance, and many times during the story one is tempted to question his intentions -- but his ""explanation"" to Harry at the end of the book is hardly satisfying.  I personally do not feel that his ""secrets,"" revealed to Harry at the very end, are ""secret"" enough to justify his lack of involvement in Harry's plight during the course of the book.  Hagrid's disappearance and the ""invisible"" Thestrals create a nice string of suspense in the beginning, but the answers to those mysteries leave me with a longing ""what?"" and a sense that my suspicions were wasted. Fred and George bore me a bit, but I quite liked their swift and sweetly rude departure.  Even still, their adventures are, at best, a convenience to the main characters when they need a miracle.  Despite Harry's tactlessness and rudeness, Cho Chang does certain things that absolutely annoy me; and none of the kids, even those in the D.A., impressed me.  And of course, Rowling succeeded in making me absolutely loathe Dolores Umbridge and the Ministry of Magic -- in fact, Umbridge's existence made the entire Hogwarts experience in book 5 a right hell on earth.The result of all this is that I don't know where my loyalties belong.Although I did want certain characters to meet an ugly end, I did not particularly want anyone to triumph.  The Order of Phoenix took their secrecy to astonishing levels, so astonishing, in fact, that I became disinterested in what they were planning after a while.  As Sirius says, ""the world isn't divided into good wizards and Death Eaters,"" and when you have a bunch of newly introduced wizards who just don't make an impression, it seems that everyone is just somewhere in the gray area.  The loyalty summoned for Sirius Black and Remus Lupin at the end of book 3 is nonexistent here.When you go through most of the book with such a mindset, the shock effect of the tragic death seems greatly compromised.  Many have criticized the lack of emotion of the surviving characters after the death.  While some suspect that Lupin's lack of response to the tragedy sprouts from connections with the Dark Arts, I think that very simply, Rowling was tired.  She has little energy left to devote to investigating character emotions by the end of the book.  But from another perspective, the question arises: if the members of the Order are fighting so hard for the good of the wizarding community so as to ignore the deaths of those closest to them, then what stronger value lies in these sacrifices?  If the Order is urged to usher away feelings of loss of their loved ones for the ""greater"" notion of martyrdom, then how can they convince, even when they have succeeded, the rest of the wizarding world to value love, loyalty, and brotherhood?  With all of these questions in my mind, and an accumulated boredom that has reached quite a high level, the death of my favorite character made only a small impact.  I suspect that Rowling would not have expected this reaction.  She does, however, make a rather feeble attempt to hammer in the sense of loss and ""what if"" after the character's death.  Yes, the entire tragedy could have easily been prevented had Harry just had a little more faith in his elders, and in the love that they have for him.  Or if he had more respect for the years of experience that elude him in youth.  But even these sighs of regrets are faint.  I wait casually for the next one...and will probably make Azkhaban the last HP movie I watch in the theaters.",FALSE,2003,1475
"5947",4,731545,FALSE,"When I first read this book, I was a bit disappointed as to how angry Harry seemed to be, and how his temper seemed to get the best of him.

I definitely have come to love this book as much as the other 4, but it took me another reading or two.  Harry faces his toughest challenges yet, and Hermione and Ron are not the only ones who help him out of tight spots throughout the year.  I just love how J.K. Rowling continues to develop not just the main characters, but other ones as well, i.e. Nevill Longbottom and Ginny Weasley.  I almost have come to feel like I know these kids personally, having watched them grow through the series, and of course, meeting new ones, like Luna Lovegood.  Harry's crush on Cho Chang left me with a feeling of ""too bad"", but alas, not all crushes wind up with happy endings, do they?

There were many new magical things in the book, just like there are in all of the other books which is good because it never got old. One of the best things is that it keeps you guessing the entire time, though it wasn't as twisted as the second, third, and fourth books. The only problem, was that it was a little bit slow for a couple chapters, but that could have just been incapacitating excitement disabling my ability to really concentrate on what was happening in the story.

Now I have finished Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and  ready to mail it off to my granddaughter.  There will be a standing order  for the 4th book as soon as Amazon lists it. What fun!  I have started  other grandmothers into the sending the books to their grandkids, too.  So  from this 72 year old grandma---keep the books coming.

Harry did tend to be a bit more moody/angry than necessary. Personally, I was looking for resolutions on Fred and George, Percy and Cho. Perhaps resolution is not quite accurate but Percy's ignorance towards his family should have been addressed once more when the Ministry publically accepted Voldermort's return. Loved Fred & George's ""flight"" but really was anxious to hear Mrs Weasley's take on the episode. Totally in agreement with the reviewer who stated the great secret of the book was a bit of a disappointment. Although, perhaps if one of the two does die by the end of the Seventh book it won't be so bad. I mean the prophecy that one must die for the other to survive is kinda pointless if it ends with them still both struggling against the other. Perhaps I am missing something too, but what if it is that they just continue to battle all their life, what  does that prophecy mean, that if they both live they cant help but fight? Like magnets drawn to one another. I mean Harry is already 15 years old, so is there no time limit on this destroying the other in order to survive? Maybe its just me but big deal one has to die, we always knew Voldermort wanted to kill Harry, thats no secret.  This now is posing another question for me, if Dumbledore was so interested previously that Voldermort took some of Harrys blood to rise again, and part of Voldermort is with Harry via the scar - how does that work?

Right now I am  going through withdrawal because I am waiting for book four. I have read  the first three 6 times each and listened to the tapes for The Prisoner of  Azkaban. Mz.

Sirius Black (here's a name for the star  gazers and mythology buffs) is an enigmatic soul with a very personal tie  to the Potter family.

You also find out the truth that the prisoner, Sirius Black, was innocent and how his parents were betrayed that led them to their deaths. There is so much more new information but I can't ruin the rest. My favorite part was when Harry and Hermione had to go back in time, save two lives, and make it back in time without being caught.

You also are introduced to more depths of existing characters. You feel for Harry. You can actually feel his anger and pains. Hermoine is still trying to free the elves. Of course, Ron has his thoughts on this subject. I love the fact that they are bringing back alot of characters that you have not heard from since previous novels.Well done.

"5959",3,731523,FALSE,"Just finished reading the book (spent most of my Easter holiday on it) and can't say I'm very happy with the way I've spent my time. Formidable effort by JK Rowling of course: great imagination, incredible detail, fluent writing, etc. But did it really have to be that long and gloomy?Is Rowling writing a fantasy series or an encyclopedia on the world of wizards and witches? The endless pages on the courtroom hearing, the Ministry of Magic, the exam procedures at Hogwarts, the giants and other magical creatures and the history of the magical world do contribute to the creation of a more complete world of fantasy but are they really needed (to such length) to tell the story? Has Rowling never heard of the literary technique of suggestion and the concept of only elaborating on things that really matter for the story?And what's all that repetition needed for? How many time does Harry have to lose his temper to show that he's struggling with puberty? How many times does his stomach have to jump to show that he's somewhat in love with Cho? And how many punishments and disappointments does he have to suffer to show that his fifth year at Hogwarts is not an easy one?I'm suspecting Rowling either of experiencing a sadistic pleasure in torturing her hero with all the misfortunes imaginable, or of using Harry as a vehicle for therapeutically writing off her personal frustrations and negative memories.All those negative feelings of guilt, shame, loss, sadness, loneliness, insecurity, frustration, stress, humiliation, confusion and pain that Harry has to suffer do not really make for entertaining reading, either. If it hadn't been for the last 75 pages (only seventy five!), where the action finally picks up, I would have finished my reading in a truly depressed mood. I appreciate that the life of many teenagers isn't sunshine all the way but does all this negativity really have to be the focus of a book you're supposed to be reading for pleasure?I'm really starting to get worried about the last two episodes, as the trend apparent from the first 5 books seems to be for the books to get thicker, more encyclopedic and gloomier. As if Rowling is planning never to write another book again and is desperately cramming all her ideas, feelings and memories into the final instalments.I sincerely hope that book 6 will normal sized (a story that can't be told in 350 odd pages is probably not a good story), lighter in tone (not very optimistic on this point, though, as the 2nd Wizard War is announced in the last chapter) and filled with action and fantasy rather than emotion and facts. See what happened to the Star Wars saga when inventor George Lucas, writing his episode IV and V, forgot that what people loved about the first 3 episodes was the excitement of the story and the dreamaway fantasy. It's the entertainment, stupid! (no offence meant, JK)",FALSE,2004,1802
"5960",2,731192,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, well what can I say after a three year wait.  This the fifth installment in the Potter series is much darker and (after you have read the first two chapters) more predictable than the rest.  Harry is no longer the innocent, brave, and heroic wizard we all met in the first novel and continued to love into the fourth.  He has become an angry, often raving mad, rash, and for lack of a better description troublemaker.  His actions most of which are against the new DADA teacher end with the revalation (to the fictional wizarding world) of LV's return and the capture of several of his followers, during which all of his friends that follow him manage to get taken out of action with various injuries.  The conflict at the end of the book has all the movie quality action (or for that matter Harry Potter quality) of a 'C' action flick.  This all could have been accomplished in the first 10 pages of the book, and in my opinion should have been, off scene by the Ministry of Magic.  Once you realize where the book is going you can predict everything thats going to happen to Harry, in other words you know that he is going to have the most miserable year of his life, and if you know the character 'that is saying something'.  Anyone who was unable to predict what ""everything"" was that Dumbledoor explained, or for that matter anyone who was shocked by it, does not understand the meaning of revelation.  Harry's destiny to destroy LV was evident from the first novel.  The story leaves the reader wanting to know what comes next in the series, but with the sinking feeling that the author not only did have writer's block during the three year break, but that the bad things that seemed to happen to Harry all year was the author's way of striking back against the fans.  Sort of a ""see what I can do"" stategy of writing rather than a continuation of the style we all love from the previous books.  The book does not even have the part most people wanted in a Potter novel, he does not do anything spectacularly magical and ""great"" that we can look at and say ""wow he is an amazing person"".  Instead we are left with an extremly angry and depressed Harry that has a power that is eternally locked behind a door (which is suggested but not said is Love).  I will probably read the next book in the series, but if it is on the same scale as this one I won't be reading the seventh.  This one novel has not lost me as a Potter fan, but it has come close.  Potter fans deserve better and I for one was very dissapointed.",FALSE,2003,1471
"5961",5,731890,FALSE,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter book series and have never been dissapointed by the outcome of any of the books. So I was pleased to find that this book kept with the tradition of making me happy to read it. However, there were a few things that kept bothering me. Like the fact that Harry was so angry and frustrated all of the time. He took all of his aggressions out on everyone who really cared about him. Which I thought was a little selfish. I realize that he had a tough year but he really should have tried to except the support that his friends were giving him.I have a tendency to think of Harry as a real person just simply because I have read the entire series, like many other people, and it begins to feel like I know him. I think that is the point of a series like this and should be the goal of any book. To make the reader feel as if the characters are real and that these things are really happening now. I enjoy the oppurtunity to escape in a good book every once and a while and it's nice to know that J.K. Rowling has given many other people who normally wouldn't read that oppurtunity as well.This particular book ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is probablly one of my favorites of the series. Because it shows Harry growing up and becoming more of the person I expected him to be. It's almost like the Star Wars movies though. In the sense that he is starting to show an angrier and more powerful side. That is similar to Darth Vadar. But of course, I can only hope that he will be able to use his anger and power for good opposed to the way Darth Vadar used his.My hope for the 7th book is it to be a very satisfying conclusion. I don't particularly like books, or movies for that matter, that leave me hanging. In a book series this long and involved it would be only fair for J.K. Rowling to end it properly. Hopefully it will be with Harry using his ever growing power for good and not evil.",FALSE,2005,2169
"5963",4,731867,FALSE,"The Fifth book in the Harry Potter series ""Order Of the Pheonix"" is an action packed drama filled with teenage angst.  So when I read it for the first time I was very displeased.  This being of course because Harry is very angry about a lot of things. Basically, if you want to me sum up 7/8 of the book all you would have to do is read the chapter in ""The Goblet of Fire"" when Cornelius Fudge disbelieves that Lord Voldemort has fully returned, and we all know how frustraing that chapter was, I mean ignorance is a very annoying thing. So what you might be saying when you read this book is a long the lines of ""Oh Man, this is really getting frustrating, errrrrr""  For this reason it is understandable why the reader may not like this book.BUT!Did you ever think about the fact that you may have been given these feelings for a reason. I mean the fact that you, the reader got so frustrated means that JK Rowling REALLY got her point across. I mean its genius. she got right into your head and really made you feel the way Harry and everyone else who knew the truth do. I mean truthfully, she is an amzing writer. the sense of relief you get at the very end of the book. I think she knows she had to write this book the way it was written in  order to make 6 and 7 unbelievable stories.So with all that said, I promise you that if you read this book for a second time, it is ten times better because you'll start to realize what Rowling is doing.Now we just have to wait till July 16th. and I think these are a few thigs we can expect:Ron and Hermione falling in loveMaybe Harry and, I know you think I'm crazy but, Luna Lovegood hooking upObviously the revealing of the ""Half Blood Prince"" (I think its Hagrid)and ofcourse a completely different quidditch team.Also I belive Ron will be Quidditch captain.

"5966",5,731483,FALSE,"I ran into this book while shopping with my mom in a nearby store. I had no idea that J.K. Rowling had published another book and since I have read the first four I decided to take on this one too. So I purchased the book and decided to take a look at it. During the first part of the book it went really slow and almost made me think I should quit reading it. But some pages later the book started to pick up its tempo and I was immediately entranced by the book. J.K. Rowling goes into much detail with the book and answers a lot of question I had on Harry Potter that I wasn't able to pick up in the first few books. Also it seems like she also put a lot more dialogue in this book than she did with the others. Though one could say that this was a bad thing it was actually quite interesting and helpful. I was able to learn more about other characters too while I was reading, what was humorous to them, how they react to danger, what they do when they want to act mischievous. A lot of the characters that were not really mentioned in the other books actually appear more in this book. Overall this book was really exciting and worth a 5 out of 5. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure.",FALSE,2004,1762
"5968",4,731180,FALSE,"At last, the moment thousands of Harry Potter fans have been anxiously waiting for- the fifth instalment in J.K Rowling's epic tale! Or so we thought... To be honest most of us assumed that the sheer size and the wait for 'The Order of the Phoenix' would equate to a literary extravaganza with more thrills, spills, twists and turns than ever before. Sadly, this volume seems somewhat diminished when compared to the magnitude of its media hype and the expectations of Rowling's fans. Personally, after reading and re-reading the 'Order', I was left feeling a bit like Gilderoy Lockhart- slightly bemused but somewhat empty. However, I must also admit that I found it nearly impossible to put down once I began reading it.A competent young reader should not feel daunted by the size of the book but there are a few moments where the length of detail is unnecessary. For instance, it takes Harry 166 pages just to get on the train, whereas the climatic ending is only a paltry 48 pages. The editing could have been a little more brutal and leaving in Hagrid's brother for the purpose of intrigue was unnecessary.The consistency of her books has always been one of Rowling's hallmarks but there are several cases when things seem to have 'apparated' out of thin air. Dumbledore's confession at the end of the book also feels somewhat intangible, as does the issue of Sirius's mirror. As for the protagonist, I had first felt that Harry's new attitude was a bit over the top. I have always been the same age as Harry but this time around I found him a bit hard to relate to. That being said, I have just begun the muggle version of O.W.Ls (the Cambridge AS year) and I must admit, most teens do become moody, suspicious and surly at this age. Yet once again too much time is devoted to an issue, which is not entirely essential, and his short temper does seem a little inconsistent for a person who used to let nothing get him down.The action in this book was also somewhat sporadic and was not helped by the lack sufficient 'Quiddich' moments. The end was also a letdown as it lacked that sharp, unpredictable quality which Harry Potter fans have come to love. I was also somewhat surprised by the lack of a big showdown between Harry and Lord Voldemort, especially after all the suspense created in the previous book. As far as I'm concerned, the 'Goblet of Fire' is far superior in suspense and sustained action.This is not to say that the 'Order of the Phoenix' not have its good points. The Weasley twins have remained amongst Rowling's most vivid and entertaining characters and the ""pallid, toadlike"" Delores Umbridge is deliciously vile. As an agnostic I also appreciated Luna Lovegood's subtle suggestion regarding what comes after death, after the demise of a prominent character.Overall, this cynical teen found J.K Rowling's latest edition entirely spellbinding, even though she ignored the proven fact that less is generally more. Her description and character depth were to her usual high standards as was her continuation of previous subplots and minor characters. She also has another two volumes in which to prove that her standards have not slipped entirely. Fortunately, I am sure most of her younger readers will be able to over look the less than enchanting plot in order to once again appreciate the magic of Harry Potter.",FALSE,2003,1459
"5971",4,731195,FALSE,"After reading all the Harry Potter books numerous times I read The Order of the Phoenix and found it very well written, captivating, surprising, and in general thought provoking.One negative in the book is Harry's outbursts of anger (especially in the beginning). They got to be quite annoying simply because they were so constant. However, he does learn to control his temper later in the book. Overlooking his teenage hormones, the book was awesome! This was the first book of the series that literally made me drop my jaw! (See big news about Mrs. Figg). I must say that it was a book that really made me think. When I first finished it I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not. This was mostly due to how intense the final chapter were. Overall, though, it was fantastic and really funny.I would definitely  recommend this book, but not for ages 9-12. After reading it, I believe JK Rowling wrote it for ages 12 and up because the vocabulary is defiantly over a 9-year-olds level. Also the book is not just for children but for adults and teens as well.

"5975",4,730027,FALSE,"The latest in Rowling's series was as interesting as the first two, and the author seems to get better the more she writes.  I enjoyed the work and couldn't put it down, but as an adult reader I realize that the magic in  the stories isn't real.  My concern with this book more so than with the  previous two is that the magic in it borders on the occult.  Her earlier  two works were not as questionable, but as she progresses, I find myself  becoming concerned about the wisdom of exposing children to these powers.  Another concern is that Harry often tells ""white lies"" to get out  of trouble and never gets caught.  These two problems point out to me that  the book does not present a negative enough view of evil, and I advise  parents to read the book before allowing their children to do so.  If they  allow their children to read it, I suggest discussing the nature of the  magic with them as they read the story as well as the fact that truth, as  Rowling is quick to point out, is the best course of action.",FALSE,2000,306
"5976",4,731192,FALSE,"When I finally finished reading the last chapter of the book, I was left wanting more.  Partly because ""Harry Potter and the Order of the  Phoenix"" proved to be an addictive read, and partly because I was a bit unsatisfied.  (mind you, read it from cover to cover without being able to put the book down).  Perhaps the feeling of unsatisfaction was left there by Harry's constant moodiness (but, I'm sure we've all experienced that at 15-- and I do realize that for Harry it has only been but a month since the tragic events of book 4).  I was still waiting, two-thirds into the book, for the adventure to start; and when it came it seemed to come and go in a flash.  At the plot level, there were very few of the twists and turns I've come to expect from the Harry Potter series.  The ""Order of the Phoenix"" though, is an excellent window into Harry's feelings and thoughts.  I think it serves as a point of convergence, where all previously gained knowledge about Harry and his world, and especially about his link to Voldemort are finally laid out and explained.  From this point on, Harry has full knowledge of who he really is and it will be very exciting to see what J.K. Rowling has in store for us in the next two books.",FALSE,2003,1471

Rowling manages to keep the character true to his age while having him experience such dramatic and unusual events.  We can understand and sympathise with his frustrations.

Like her other novels about Harry, this one is well-crafted, plot-driven and very entertaining, spiced with both humour and horror. To me, her greatest achievement is the realism with which she portrays her young protagonists in their fantastic setting. Harry, in this book, is absolutely a teenager - snarly, unreasonable, impulsive, depressed - but loving and loveable, despite all this. And Ron and Hermione continue absolutely true to form, but, like Harry, gain more depth. Surrounding characters also get a bit more limelight and some interesting developments - particularly the Weasleys, Neville Longbottom, and Professor Snape!I do not want to say too much in this review - I don't want to give away any surprises! On the whole, though, I will say that the plotting of this book is excellent, the characterizations and descriptions sharp, and, though more sombre in tone than its predecessors, this volume still bubbles with humour.Be warned that there are some disturbing elements. Grownups, even those the young hero idolizes, have terrible faults, and evil is omnipresent and in places really horrifying. In fact, in my view, Harry Potter is no longer a book for little kids, if it ever was, but upper elementary, middle school and high school students will love it - and with good reason.Only a couple of things disappoint me in this book. One is the ending, which is both a little too pat and - oddly - not quite dramatic enough. The other is a certain amount of stereotyping. There is a new and very unlovely house elf, whose role is quite ambiguous, and who thus adds to the shades of grey in which JKR is now working. However, the whole house elf problem remains quite disturbing - all of these creatures, whether good or bad, are ""Uncle Tom""-like in their servitude, perpetuating stereotypes of the happy slave. Equally disturbing, in my view, is the perennial ""Madame Pince,"" the horrible Hogwarts librarian, whose main role seems to be keeping the books away from the students!As a Youth Services librarian, I wish J.K. Rowling would get rid of Madame Pince and invent someone a little more true to life! She has introduced a great new female character in this book, the Auror Tonks, who might make an excellent library assistant - or perhaps she could even kick out Madame Pince in a future novel and replace her with (gasp!)

Rowling portrays every feeling Harry has through the whole book with such magnificent detail that you will be able to feel Harry's joy and dismay as passionately as the character himself.  I am very happy to report that J.K. has kept to her promise as she continues to increase the maturity of these books as the series progresses, this installment being even more dark and solemn than the last one.  J.K. is able to breakup this tension quite well however, with zany antics from the Weasley twins and Harry's hopeless attempt at trying to understand adolescent girls.

Since the reader always sees events through Harry's eyes, the 15 year old gives the book a more mature outlook on good and evil; the ""good guys"" are not perfect anymore (harry must re-learn to love and accept James and Sirius despite thier youthfull arrogance), and some of the inner fear that drives Voldemort is revealed.  Even the cruely unfair ex-Death Eater Prof. Snape is given a chance to show that he truly sides with Dumbledore and, however grudgingly, with Harry. At the end, Harry must confront a startling prophesy and readers are left wanting more - even if book 6 is three times as long!

Absolutely!All the critic's reviews talk about the ""coming of age"" and the ""dark"" side of the book.  This simply means Harry is angry and/or confused.  A lot.  It takes 3 or 4 of Harry's outbursts for the reader to get that he's an angst-ridden teenager.  The next 3 or 4 outbursts drive the point home.  The next 3 or 4 outbursts get a little tiresome.  After that I found myself skipping ahead whenever an outburst flared up and that kept happening right up to the last pages.  The editors could have cut out 50-60 pages worth of redundant material (Harry exploding, Hermione nagging, Ron looking surprised/hurt) without losing anything from the story and it would have made for a smoother read.That being said, there's lots to like in the book and JK has packed in a lot of material that gives her fans something to talk about while at the same time laying the groundwork for the upcoming installments.

It had the mystery which kept the reader glued to every page, from Harry's lamentable life at number 4 privet drive, to that string of hope of having some semblance of family at the introduction of Sirus Black. What an incredibly written novel. As for the Order of the Pheonix, lady Rowling seemed to be grasping at the success of her previous novels. With this new novel she seemed to be writing for her fans instead of just for herself the way the first three books clearly comes across.  She seemed so cautious with what the fans might think. It merely became a long written novel that kept going on and on without really getting anywhere. And the battle at the end seemed so hurried and recklessly written.  And her new depiction of harry's character leaves much to be desired. Harry although having displayed some hints of impulsiveness was never at all reckless.  She displayed him as somewhat of an ""angry youngman"". Always shouting and loosing his temper.  Harry was never like this in the past.  He was a lonely lad, hungry for affection and love, but he knew how to see the brighter side of things. Thats why despite his difficult life at privet drive he still knew how to smile. However I still have not lost faith in lady Rowling. I know how difficult it must be to write the story of a character that has clearly grown to have a life of its own.  I can't wait for book six.

Rowling has set the stage for this book in such a way that every miniscule detail in the story screams at you, and every character and plot development is suspect.

I never imagined it would be HIM for those of you who are reading it but don't know who dies. Some people complain about the words and the books being to hard to read and understand, but I think it helps you learn. When I read the first book I was in 1st grade. Now I'm in 5th grade and still read the books. It's very clever that J.K.Rowling conects the books together a little. Like for example, you have so many questions after you read the first book, but when you read the 2nd one next, it anwsers your questions! Like an example of that would be why does Harry Potter feel you know who's emotions? In the 5th book that is anwsered by Dumbledoore, the Headmaster at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardy. The books are scary, funny, silly, serious, sad, depressing, enraging, inspiring, addictive, and mysterious. They can make you feel so many different emmotions at once.

This book is the most humorous, and most sentimental of a series that is to consist of seven novels. The plot is centered around, (apart from, obviously Harry), a wizard who has escaped from wizard prison, and is convicted of having murdered thirteen people with a single curse. When thirteen year old Harry Potter finds out that Sirius Black supposedly escaped from wizard prison with the motive of killing him, Harry doesn't konw what to think. The plot in this book is far too good to be spoiled by a review, so I won't do so. This book contains excellent humor, and lots of good attention to the Weasely twins, and the pasts of Harry's parents. Look for creatures and spells not found in the first two books. even new classes. this book is part of a culture of fun and humor, coupled with thrilling suspense, and happy endings. Not too scary or strange for children, and also great reading for young adults and adults alike.

"6004",5,731185,FALSE,"Wow.  Like others have already stated, this book is perhaps JK Rowling's best to date.  Old characters return, and previously marginal characters really flesh out more, grow up a little, and add a little humor as well.  Harry really grows up as well.  Unlike earlier books, he isn't the king of absolute serendipity, such as when the coveted position of Prefect goes to Hermoine and Ron instead of him; when everyone in the school, and perhaps the entire wizard/witch community, thinks he's mad; when he no longer has Dumbledore there to protect him; when Hogwarts seems to be nearing extinction; when Harry gets his first kiss and with Cho of all girls.  You also get to see much more of the Twins (Fred and George), more of their character, more of their involvement in school, and wicked bow out towards the end.  Neville, the oafish clutz of Harry's entering class, starts to show signs of becoming quite a wizard himself and contributes greatly to Harry's truimph in the end (we also find out an extraordinary tie between him and Harry).  Best of all, Ron makes the Quidditch team, and true to his character, he's absolutely horrid as a keeper.  But probably the most interesting revelation is perhaps the longest scene we get to see of Harry's parents.  Harry gets to see into the past and learns that his father is not quite the man he's always believed him to be, and that Snape, for all his callous criticism towards Harry, is not undeserving of sympathy.Some of the draw backs of giving more ink to marginal characters is the disappearance of old characters.  Dumbledore is mentioned althroughout the book, but he rarely enters the scene.  Hagrid is also gone throughout most of the book on a secret mission.  Snape gets his usual press.  Lupin, however, makes a return.All in all, if you're a Harry Potter fan--and I'm sure you are--you'll be amazed at how Rowling could have possibly topped the success of her previous four novels.

Is true that in this book Harry is more angry and resentful, but after what he has gone through all of his life (and in this book it doesn't get better), you can't do anything but comprehend him. The author is trying to make him the more human possible and Harry has had enough, and I think everyone can relate to that. Also, this book answers most of our questions that were unanswered in the past four books. This book is dark, but I still think book 4 is darker.

In fact the major plotline probable could have been left out without much difficulty. The only thing I can think of is that Rowling decided to use the the overly long story line as some sort of pretext for future novels. A couple of the minor plot lines such as the student dada organization and the death of the major character do make major impacts on the overall arc of the story. All in all the book is a good addition to the Harry Potter collection but will confuse most younger readers. Plus parents may want to note that the last portion of the book that containes the death of a Character may really scare children younger than there teens.

People who like loose ends tied up will appreciate it more.The book starts slow and but when it speeds up it doesn't slow down again until the very end. The slow start is fine as wallowing in Harry's world is such a nice diversion.

And moving.Not to mention absolutely amazing.I don't think that I've ever been so emotionally involved in a book - and having perhaps read more books that some people ever read in a lifetime, that's saying something.I raged at the world with Harry, I wanted to strangle (or at the very least seriously maim) the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I burst into hysterical sobs when - well - that person died (not telling!). I gasped, I giggled, I sighed, I smiled smugly as certain characters got their what-fors...JKR's back, and she's brought with her everything about Harry that we've ever loved, and more. Don't be surprised if you come out of your reading experience believing it's the best one in the series to date.And if you read this book and didn't get something out of it, not even a laugh, or a gasp of indignation, or a 'Well done, Ms. Rowling', I'd be seriously worried about your sanity.Now please excuse me while I go run outside and squeal like the proud Potterhead I am.",FALSE,2003,1467

Harry is searching for the truth, this leads him to the Ministry of Secrets. In the end Harry must expose the secrets of Voldemort without disclosing his own secrets... Harry has evolved into a Dark character and the only difference I see between him and Voldemort is that Harry tries to empower his friends rather than control them like Voldemort. This leads to various betrayals (Can you compare Harry to King Arthur)? This novel is  bittersweet: i.e. Harry is elevated yet he has lost those he cares about, and those he has not lost have betrayed him (Even those that help him have betrayed his confidence). Will good defeat evil? Obviously Harry could afford to buy whatever he wants, (Everything but true love and acceptance).

"6038",5,731229,FALSE,"I give Hary Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 5 stars because it is truly the best book I have ever read. In my opinion it was by far the best of the Harry Potter series, being well written and definitely intriguing.  I read it's 870 pages in 6 days, which is the fastest I have ever read a book, and I can truly say that this novel along with the rest of the series are the only books I read for pleasure.  I think that this book was better then the others because it required a deeper level of understanding, and evoked more emotion.  In the same sense, I think that this factor also was the one small thing that I did not enjoy about the novel; it made it less easier for young children to understand. Also, since it was on a more mature level, there was less adveture involved than in the other four, and at a few parts it seemed to drag on longer and slower than the others.  Aside from that, everything else in this book was very intersting and exciting.  The main reason why I loved this book was because of a few of my favorite parts.  One was the part where Hermione was in critical condition; I enjoyed the suspense of whether she would survive or not, and it made me really think of what Hogwarts would be like without her.  I also enjoyed being releived and happy when she turned out to be okay.  Another favorite part was when Harry gets to see the flashback of his parents at Hogwarts, because I was happy that Harry got to experience what his parents were like.  Lastly, I loved when Dumbledore explains to Harry why everything happened to him the way it did, and his prophecy which I will not give away.  Everything made sense after his explanation, and when it did, that is when I truly grew to love the book.

I felt almost stupid, as if I should have recoginized how  the ending would be, although it's so unexpected, I'm sure you'll feel the  same way.Another thing: I am caught between hysteric laughter and heated  argument whenever I hear about parents not allowing their children to read  or hear these books read - it's utterly ridiculous! They have absolutely  NOTHING in them that would make your kids try to fly off the roof on  broomsticks or nonsense like that.Granted, there is always whiplash  when something phenomenally popular comes out (like Pokemon) but this is  the first time I've felt compelled to take a stand against it.Bottom  line: A must read - a stunning example of children's fiction.

As someone who writes for pleasure myself, after reading the first four Potter books I threw away my pen. Why should I bother anymore? This woman does it all! The stories are real (yet fantasy), the characters so three dimensional I want to buy a ticket to London to go meet them. The storylines are so well-done I cannot fathom how she does it. I keep asking myself, ""Does this woman even realize what she has done, is doing? Does she work diligently to make everything weave so well or does she have some miraculous gift, some unknowable genius to produce such work?""The Order of The Pheonix cements in my mind, that Ms. Rowling deserves every dime that she gets from her work and more. This book shows a maturing of not only the characters and storylines but of the issues presented. How such concepts can be presented in such pure, readable form amazes.

One thing I really like about the series is that you can see her writing progress as she hones her craft.Books 3 and 5 are the best in the lot so far because of their character development.  Rowling's brilliance also shines through her creativity.  Books 1, 2 and 4 are comparatively pedantic is style, but not in creativity.  The first one, while a good story, is mediocre in style.  Book Two is terrible for its use of deus ex machina, but also a good story overall.  Ditto for Book 4.Another thing I like about her writing overall is that she doesn't fall into the ""exposition trap"" like a lot of writers.  She doesn't spend paragraphs regurgitating salient parts; she expects you to have read them.  She alludes to these salient parts in passing, and leaves them as little cliff hangers for those who haven't read the previous ones.  Although the books are unusually long, they do not drag.  Rowling keeps them well-paced.I can't wait to see what she does with books 6 and 7, and I'd really like to see the first few years of Harry's adulthood after graduation.  I hope they start breaking the movies into two parts each.  The Prisoner of Azkaban movie didn't do the book justice, but there's just no way a single feature-length film can do justice to the next books, either, due to the sheer lengths of the books.",FALSE,2005,2169

The Order of the Phoenix is an organisation against Voldemort. Dumbledore is the head of this order. The Ministry of Magic thinks he is trying to spread a false rumour that Voldemort is back. There is less of a feeling that Harry is actually in Hogwarts in this story. Harry loses his temper a lot more - he has a lot more problems that in the last books. Some old characters reappear and there are some interesting new characters too. It is a lot more exciting towards the end because Harry and other students from Hogwarts have to try to get something before Voldemort does. The book is serious, overall, but there are some funny bits thrown in!I think it would be more suitable for older readers because when I was reading it, it felt a bit more grown up than the other ones.

The story is darker, more dangerous, and more magical than the previous novels.J.K Rowling writes with such magic and even though the book is longer than all of the others in the series, it is the most intriguing and exciting.The last two hundred pages of this book will leave you breathless and exhausted such is the action and suspense that take place, but I can assure you will leave you craving for more.In other words a fantastic novel that is recommended to everybody.

We learn more about his rage, his life, his questions, and the answers to them. More people around him seem to be taking him more seriously, and treating him less as a prodigy boy.  People are beginning to also get ""fed up"" with him, if you get my meaning.  This makes the book deeper, and harry's thoughts tell us that he doesn't understand a lot of things...which is also frustrating to the reader.  These books have evolved from a child's series to a seriously entertaining mystery and thriller.  Hermione's still my favorite character. It is true that someone at the end of the book dies, but I won't tell you (although you'll find it a relief to know that it's not one of the three you'd hate to die!)

Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix (now brace yourself) is a bad book.Hear me out:  The plot, granted, thickens, and the story has potential to be touching, but this information is presented to you in a way as to be colorless.  Harry, fast becoming an exemplary raging delinquent, causes you to become vaguely annoyed with him and not the least bit sympathetic.  None of the other characters have developed, and seemed much the same as the day they arrived at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  And as for the infamous death scene, I was getting so exasperated with the character I didn't remotely care when he died.All in all, the book seems to have no depth, and JK Rowling's style is getting some what repetitive.

The BIG secret is slightly disappointing after many months of speculation, and the death is not who you would actually expect it to be, but quite sad nonetheless and leaving Harry with a huge whole in his life. Harrys love life peaks and fades over the course of the book, and its no secret that Cho causes all of it! Unfortunately Ron and Hermoine don't get to see any romance, but I'm sure in the next books that will be rectified!

The fan whose anticipation is free of ulterior motives, however, and who delights in the thought of eight-hundred and seventy pages of uninterrupted brand-new Harry Potter will not be disappointed, nor will second and third readings be far behind the first.

However, sometimes the level of complication derails the action, as when, in this third book, Harry finally meets Sirius Black, and Rowling, in order for Harry and her readers to understand the truth of his parents' death, has a lot of explaining to do, pages of it. In fairness, I think it would be short of miraculous if she were able to keep the action rolling in such a way as to impart the information required. I suspect that young readers will not be too impatient with this, however, knowing from previous books that the action will pick up again.  It occurs to me, speaking of Dickens, that the magical world Harry is increasingly a part of, is in many ways a world lacking in compassion. Prisoners of Azkaban, some of them innocent like Sirius Black and Hagrid (from Book 2)are subject to ghoulishly cruel soul-sucking Dementors. Magical creatures are subject to beheading.

Unfortunately, the high expectations that came with 3 years of waiting were not met by the time the last sentence ended.  This book is a mere shadow of the previous books.  Although it weighs in at a hefty 870 pages, remarkably little occurs amidst all those words.  Teenage angst seems to be the pervasive underlying theme and all of Harry's other, more admirable, qualities seem to take a back seat to petty resentments and hormonal confusion.  All 15 year old boys are not total idiots, but you couldn't prove it by this book.  The plot and subplots meander sluggishly with very little action by any of the characters.  Perhaps this is meant to build a sense of forboding, but simply serves to cause the reader's attention to wander.  Plot details are introduced, then ignored or simply not developed.  A slipshod lack of attention to details  leads the reader to assume Rowling tired of this book herself well before the finish.  Even the tragic death near the end seens to occur less as a climax in the plot than as a selfserving shock factor effect, and actually occurs with so little buildup or fanfare as to seem almost an afterthought. Everything is drawn out, washed out and tired.  Hopefully this is just a temporary lapse in Rowlings' usually scintillating form.  The world of Harry Potter in the 4 previous books is filled with vivid characters living in a magical, glorious, absorbing world so crisply drawn as to sparkle with life,moral struggles and emotion on every page.

Harry's temper could be blamed on being a teenager but at some point, J.K. really should have realized how aggravating it is to read after so many pages of it!

They truly affect Harry's life and who he is.  While books 4 and 5 are longer, POA gives more new information and has more significant events.

Because our heroes are growing up their emotional lives are written with more complexity.Some highlights from the initial reading:Neville's growth as a character (and some surprising revelations!), insights into Snape and his animosity toward James Potter, and reflections on hero-worship and the change of a child's perspective on his parents.Dumbledore's lengthy exposition near the end almost seems anti-climactic in light of the more subtle reflections elsewhere.It doesn't feel as bloated as The Goblet of Fire and it goes a long way to clear up a lot of the seemingly useless detail from that one.Overall, a satisfying enough story to keep us hanging on another couple of years until the next one, and a complex enough story to give us something to gnaw on til then.",FALSE,2003,1467
"6076",5,731599,FALSE,"Wow. I really think this was an amazing book. The way that J.K. Rowling strung her words and sentences together, it really got my attention from the very first sentence. This book's ending really got my attention and surprised me. I didn't think that what happened was going to. Sometimes it's the surprising things at the end of the books that keep it interesting. This book involved a lot of detail, and it must have taken some good work and a lot of time to write and publish this book. The good detail in this story made me feel like I was there in the middle of the scene, actually there with all the characters, thinking their thoughts and feeling their emotions. This quality is what kept me reading on. (and on and on!) I thought that the plot itself was interesting, but I didn't really like the new character. She was extremely maddening, but if I think about it, I know that she was necessary to the story. But I didn't really like the ending. I do not like that someone that good hearted and likeable died, especially since he has been in every one of the books since the third one. But I liked the story overall, and I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books. Some people's parents do not want their child reading these books because of the ""ridiculous"" ideas of wizards and witches, magic and magic schools. But I disagree with these people. I think that these books, especially this one, number five, are wonderful children and adult books. A lot of parts in this story got me surprised when I read it. I would be shocked and not expecting it, and I thought that this book was a real page turner. I could hardly put it down. This book created conflicting emotions in me. There were happy and sad parts, embarrassing parts, and shocking parts. And along with the character feeling these emotions, I also felt them. J.K. Rowling really writes in a way that you are in sync with the characters in the book, and you feel the way that they do. Because of this, I spent a few days after school sitting on the couch reading Harry Potter. I really loved this book, and it is now on my list of favorite books of all time, and I am sure that I will be reading it again and again. I will be sure to tell people about this book, and I recommend it to anyone who likes books that are long, well written, and wonderfully detailed. It is a wonderful book for children and adults alike, and trust me, you will not be sorry for reading this book. You are definitely going to love the way it is written. So sit down on the couch, maybe grab a friend and crack open this book.",FALSE,2004,1878

But the second group ( which i count myself in ) reads the book with crave for information, just to quench their thirst to learn more about Harry and his life. That's why we are NOT disappointed but sad. I love Harry and his companions, and I understand his mood. I felt the same pain whenever he raised his voice or displayed his anger because he had all the right to do so. I just hoped that the harshness of life wouldn't darken his beloved heart. I just hope that he could find peace in his heart and learn to live with his pain.

"6081",4,731193,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a good novel reflecting on Harry Potter's fifth year in Hogwarts. Trapped in his summer home- the Dursleys, Harry is very annoyed the Voldemort, after his return at the end of the previous year, has not yet reveled himself. When there is less than a month left before his return to Hogwarts, Harry is resqued by the Order of the Phoenix. When Harry finally returns to the school, he is faced with even more problems, the new Defence Against Dark Arts teacher (who is also the ""High Inquisitor"" at Hogwarts) and the Ministry of Magic denial of Voldemort's return.Overall, the fifth Hary Potter book talks mostly about Harry's problem's and confusions and the lengths he goes to resolve them. The book is written with a wonderful sence of humor and a philosophy that does not only apply to the wizarding world. For example, by denying the return of Voldemort, the Ministry of Magic can be compared to several existing governments (and several governments that exist no more), and the way those governments mislead their people, as well as showing how easy it is to for a government to make its people believe it.In all of Rowling's books, there existed a balance between Hogwarts and the outside world (for example, when, in the fourth book, Voldemort has returned, but the life at the school seemed to run rather smoothly). However, in the fifth book this balance is altered when in adition to the Ministry's denial and Voldemorts return, enters Professor Umbrige, to make not only the situation in the outside world difficult. This book, like the one before it, is also VERY long (he reaches Hogwarts on page 200), and many of its details do not have to be included.",FALSE,2003,1472
"6083",5,731198,FALSE,"Firstly, I'm tired of hearing people complain this book was too dark. In terms of violence, it was no worse than the 4th and 3rd book. It may have even been a bit better than the 4th book. . . considering what happened at the end of that book (but I won't spoil that for anyone who hasn't yet read that book).In terms of Harry's mood, yes, he was angrier. He is supposed to be portrayed as a 15 year old boy dealing with extremely stressful circumstances. I suppose those readers who complain about his anger have yet to meet a 15 year old boy or simply don't have memories that stretch back that far (heh, perhaps a memory charm was put in place? :) ), but I suggest you march straight to your nearest highschool and see just how happy most ""normal"" 15 year old boys are and then, after observing that, add the fact that Harry was being constantly harrassed and dealing with amazing stress to the mix. People misplace anger, people get angry to begin with, these are normal things.It would have been unrealistic and quite a terrible book had Rowling even attempted to make Harry happier. No person would have been chipper and content dealing with the things Harry was dealing with.In terms of the length, I certainly hope the books continue to grow in pages. 870 pages was not enough for me, and I am eagerly awaiting the next book (though who knows how many years that will be). I'm grateful she took the time to develop and explain things, rather than leaving gaping holes in the plot so that the story could fit neatly in a 2 hour movie time slot (as if the movies are ever as good as the books to begin with).",FALSE,2003,1477

Still, in the end, there's a feeling that there wasn't enough to it, for all the pages.  The whole book describes an in-between time.  Those in the know realize that you-know-who is back. Some wizards in high places stubbornly refuse to admit it.  So there is no widespread panic, both sides are quietly marshalling their forces, and the war hasn't really begun.  It's hard to say more without giving anything away, but the nasty little plot twists, the romance, even the disaster leaked by the editor are all somehow unimportant compared to what we know is coming soon. Or what ought be if writer's block doesn't interfere this time.  Points for having good characters who are real enough to make mistakes.  Points for humor.  Points for some of the wimpier characters beginning to come in to themselves.  Rowling clearly understands early adolescence, and likes kids.

"6087",5,731171,FALSE,"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an exciting fairytale about a boy named Harry Potter. Harry grows up with his aunt and uncle on Privet Drive. He has never known his parents because the most feared and powerful wizard, Lord Voldimort, murdered them. As Harry grows up he receives a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts Harry meets his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is a red haired, freckled faced boy who wishes he could have a glimpse of Harry's fame and glory. While on the other hand Hermoine is a bushy brown haired, know-it-all girl who could answer any question you throw at her. As Harry progressed to his third year at Hogwarts he encounters many mysterious visits from a ""Grim"". Althought Harry isn't scared of the ""Grim"", he can't help feeling that he is being followed by it. Throughout this book Harry and his friends encounter many different obstacles dealing with death and putting their lives on the line with danger to save their schoolmates and their school. To find out what happens to Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they fallow the mysterious ""Grim"", you must read this exciting page-turner. J.K. Rowling's style of writing differs from other books. She uses a gigantic variety of words and also adds in some British words to add style and character to her books. All of her exotic words describe the many different details about Hogwarts, what the different characters look like, what their expression is, and what they are doing.

I really loved how several ""loose ends"" were tied up and fit so beautifully into the story line. I laughed and I cried reading this book.

I just finished HP and the Order of the Phoenix and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I found the other four books in the series very entertaining with great stories as the framework for a very imaginative world.  This fifth book is no different.  Though it is 870 pages, I blew through it very quickly and couldn't seem to put it down.  The author did a great job of tying the plots of the previous installments together in this book quite nicely also.  She delves deeper into how Harry Potter came to be who he is and sets the stage for the sixth and seventh books very nicely.  I only wish I didn't have to wait to read those.Although not entirely necessary, I would advise reading at least, the third and fourth books before this one for plot-related reasons.  Several important characters hadn't been introduced yet in the first and second books and the main characters hadn't been developed quite as much as in the third and fourth.All in all I can't find too much to complain about.  It was worthy of the hype.",FALSE,2003,1471
"6091",2,731187,FALSE,"I'm sticking with the title of my review- the fifth book did not live up to the standards of the past four hp books. I felt that the author just filled the book up with a very unmeaningful plot as to just fill up another book. There was absolutley no point in most of the events that happened.Another major difference in this book was that in all the previous books, the ending (or near ending) would be dedicated to explaining every single odd thing that happened throughout the year- always being that the person we thought was the ""bag guy"" ended up being the ""good guy"", and vise versa. But no, the characters in this book were very usless and had no impact whatsoever on any major thing. I agree that it was also not as carefully edited as the previous four.Anothe very important matter that should be considered is under what view is HP a children's book. I believe it should be for teenagers and above due to the blood and horror and not to mention the length. Children look at a 300 paged book and sigh, let alone the fifth book- the longest yet.Now don't get me wrong, I love HP but the fifth bk just didn't match the standards. I never let go of the other HP books and just kept reading them hour after hour- but the fifth book took me 2 weeks to finish becasue the events were simply boring!The creativity was lost in this story, and so was the discriptions.

This book is about a million times worse in that Harry suffers distrust from his fellow students as well as severe punishments from the Ministry of Magic and finally a personal loss in the end of the book.  As a very sympathetic hero and also a child it is very hard to read about him having such a horrible time.I can understand why J.K. Rowling wrote this book the way she did and I think it's a very well written book.  It will no doubt be a very important part of the series.  I also have faith in her that by the end of the series I won't feel as sad about it as I do right now.

"6096",3,731190,FALSE,"Well, we've all been waiting patiently for some time for the fifth installment of the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, but I must say I am a little disapointed. The book has given more detail to many of it's main characters, including parts explaining why Snape is so cruel. This I must say makes the story much more interesting and provocative, allowing readers to understand and thus to relate more to the characters. This is a definite plus. The story however, starts to drag very early on and continues throughout the book. The story has pages seemingly added into it simply to lenghen the story, this causes real drag on what would be a nicely streamlined story. This dragging may have been intenden to increase suspence in some parts, but the author's over-use quickly becomes irritating. The story seemed to loop over upon itself, repeating similar situations and end results constantly, this gives a slight feeling of deja'vu. All-in-all this story is much the same as the others, Harry came, he saw, he conquered, narrowly escaping the Dark Lord yet again to the awe and admiration of the other characters. I read to several hours straight waiting for the story to live up to the expectations I had for it. I waited in vain. The story did indeed have many interestingly suspenseful parts but they were few and far between. By the end of the book I took Snapes opinion of Harry, He IS always trying to be a hero, and in his arrogance and disobedience he leaves casualties in his wake.

What I love about this book is that the author pulls you into the book and its kind of like your watching it, like it's a movie or something. You feel Harry's pain in this book as one bad thing after another happens to him You feel his hate for his horrible teacher Professor Umbridge and his pain of a death of a character at the end.

He was acting like a child for the first couple of chapters. Also, it seems as if Ron and Hermione will get together, which I am not particularly looking forward to.However, there are a lot of good things about the book.1. Ginny Weasley. Ginny has been one of my favorites from the begnning, and here she takes on her own personality and to date is the only one who has been able to calm down Harry and make him shut up. She is a strong character, and I hope Harry will realize that.2. The Order. It was refreshing to see new characters and a new element to the series. The order is very prominent in the book and will be for the rest of the series.3. A new layer to James. Before, we believed that Severus hated James with no reason. Now we know why and the reader is even a bit sympathetic to Severus. Sadly, though, Harry's image of his father was shattered. However, I liked looking into James' and the Marauders' world.4. The death of Sirius. This was an extremely sad event, but what it did was it opened several doors. For one, it added an air of reality to the series.

It offers the page-turming classic struggle of good versus evil found in many such epics (I am a staunch Tolkien fan). For the parents who were concerned it deals with witchcraft, magic and the occult, it does so, not as an advocate but as a vehicle for a broader moral offering.Whether Rowling intended it or not, this tale has much to say about the value of friendship, love, integrity and courage as it does anything else. And against its mythical foundation,it cautions about the corruptability of the human spirit and how evil persons ensnare others in their webs of deception.That the Potter series also sparked an enthusiasm for reading among youngsters who might otherwise be glued to a TV set, it is a small miracle.

I much enjoyed the exchange between him and Ginny, seeing how she keeps him in line when his closer friends fail to speak up. I see potential in this pairing, and if not, a strong friendship.I am absolutely in love with Neville and Hermione. Their characters were strong and are an inspiration for those who spend their whole lives trying to be the best in school, or if they're not so great in class. Just because someone is extremely smart or a little behind, doesn't make them someone you can't appreciate.This story to me was not as dark as the fourth one (being the darkest of the first four books).

This book is Harry's third year at Hogwarts, and he couldn't wait to get back.  The Dursley's continue to make his life as hard as possible, and he soon storms out of the house, walking the streets alone.  He hears of the mass murderer, Sirius Black, and his escape from Azkaban.  As Harry is staying at the Leaky Cauldron, he learns from Mr. and Mrs. Weasly that Sirius is out to kill Harry since Sirius was Lord Voldemort's sidekick, and Harry brought his downfall.  The book continues through his life at Hogwarts, the Quidditch Cup, and Harry's troubles with the dementors (guardians of Azkaban).  Harry, Ron, and Hermione manage to get themselves into exciting adventures, and learn startling truths about things.  The surprises are great and many, to say the least, and you're in for a treat.",FALSE,2001,664

He also is becoming more aware of the adult circles of action.  And he has exams to worry about, and new responsibilities he'll choose to take on.  But there are plenty of other characters, both old and new, on which to spend pages.This book shows the calm before the storm, the last months where anyone will still doubt Voldemort's return.  It isn't until the very end that deadly serious trouble breaks out.  A warning: don't expect too much about the ""weapon"" which is the focal point for this struggle.

I finished reading the 870 page book and came out thinking it was just 'ok'.  First of all, the book is 870 pages long!  And to think the 4th was going overboard.  I found it hard to concentrate on it.  Second, part of the problem is that Rowling is covering the same ground over and over.  She continues to go on about stuff that happened in the previous books, that she had already made crystal clear several times.  I think Rowling wants to out-do herself with each sequel.  As impressive as the book appears, it's not everything I had hoped for.  And now, after all the bad, the good...Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  is definately something you should read if you liked the previous Potter books and you want to keep up with the sequels and/or if you like a book with great action scenes.  Although Rowling rambles on a bit more than needed, the fighting scenes are really great.  The 5th book is darker than the others.  It deals with growing up, death, and in it's own special way, making political stands.  Rowling also touches the sensitive topic of Harry becoming a teenager.  This book covers a lot of ground.

But I wonder if his personality change, given that it was so suddent and extreme, might be related to his increased exposure to Voldemort.  They share a psychic link and Voldemort used some of Harry's blood for his regeneration.  And remember in book 4, when Harry is recounting his dual with Voldemort he says, ""He said my blood would make him stonger than if he used some else's...""  And then it reads, ""For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes.""  Maybe this personality transformation is the result of Harry's blood transfer, but ultimate it will prove to be Voldemort's undoing.  It's just a thought.

Also the amount of changes that take place in what has always been ""the norm"" in the first 4 books was quite unexpected but very refreshing, especially Dudley and Ron.

Fortunately, I was not disappointed.  It has a very interesting and suspenseful plot that anyone who appreciates a well-written fantasy novel will enjoy.  My only complaint is that this novel does not feature quite as much action as its predecessors and seems to function more as a ""bridge"" between the Goblet of Fire and the next Potter story due to the fact that it discusses the characters more than it details plot events.  Even so, the concept of the book leaves one with few complaints.  As with all other novels in the series, we discover that Hogwarts has a strange new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor.  This time, it is a mean old lady named Dolores Umbridge.  Later in the story, the students stage sort of a rebellion against Professor Umbridge by deciding to teach themselves the course's material.  In the end, it is revealed that Umbridge was appointed to Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic to keep track of Headmaster Dumbledore. One last complaint that I have is over a certain plot element that was highly hyped prior to its release.  Rowling had revealed that the death of a key character had caused her to cry and that it would incite a similar reaction amongst readers.  Also, I believe that the Potter series is gradually losing momentum, especially amongst older readers who have followed it since the introductory novel was released in 1997.

The two major events of the book, which occur in the last one hundred pages, are handled poorly. Other gripes-the three major villains of the tale are neither frightening nor dangerous (like the faux-Moody in GOF or Sirius Black in PoA), Harry's rebellion kick gets really old, Ron and Hermione spend the entire book doing nothing, and the secret is something we could have guessed since the beginning.There are some decent features-learning more about Snape, Sirius, and an increased roll for Neveille.

But after reading Order of the Phoenix, I must say I was rather disappointed.  I found it unnecessarily long, adding text without adding much substance.  Promising subplots (especially the increasingly complex character development of Professor Snape and Neville Longbottom) go nowhere, and Rowling seems more concerned about introducing potential plotlines for the next two installments rather than nailing this one down.  Worst of all, the action in Order of the Phoenix, especially the rather ho-hum climax, is, well, kinda dull.  The startling revelations and plot twists that made Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire such compelling page turners is generally absent from Order of the Phoenix.

Harry's character is unlikable for nearly the entire novel. We have to put up with his anger management problems for over 700 pages, and there is no payoff. While some critics (blind Potter followers) claim that this adds more dimension to his character, I believe that if anything it makes him less interesting. In this novel Harry is simply a famous kid who can not control his temper. And this gets old very quickly. Add to this fact, that while Harry's character changes so quickly in the span of one book, the two other primary charcters, Ron and Hermione change very little (save the utterly hapless mentions of relationships with the opposite sex). It's a very disjointed transition. And not a good one.I was at first excited by the length of the book. 870 pages of Harry Potter...that's almost 3 times the length of the original! Sadly, we pay the price for the extreme number of pages. Of the first 250 pages, there are maybe only 20-30 of substance. After the first 500, I looked back and realized that nothing had really happened. One of the most appealing features of the first three books in the series was how fast paced and exciting they were. Every aspect of that excitement has been removed in this very slow-moving novel.When you finally reach the end of this large book, you are doomed to even more disappointment.

A Harry who is sick of being ""the boy who lived"", a Harry that is sick of having more danger sent his way than anyone should and a Harry who is a typical 15 year old teen, with the usual problems that teens go through (well as typical as you can get in this situation).The book is a lot darker than the previous ones and it's nice to see that other characters are growing as well( one in particular).

In fact, it was a man by the name of Peter Pettigrew, servant of the Dark Lord and was an animagi. What is an animagi? Read the book to find out. Sirius Black was one too and he was able to transform into a great black dog.

Many knots are solved, Harry is grown by having a great loss again.I recommend this book to everyone who loves reading adventure, romance, comics,... in short to everyone who likes reading.

Readers will automatically be hooked by the best Harry Potter book yet. Harry must also deal with the tragic loss of someone very close to him. The ministry also interferes by passing a series of annoying decrees, limiting the school's power and Dumbledore's power over his students.

It makes him question some things and makes him understand why he has been treated in a certain way by someone.

I don't know how happy someone can be after that.

Harry faces some of his toughest challenges yet in this book. Like in the second book many dangers are present off and on the quidditch field.

But so are the things that make Harry's story so compelling - the adventure, the witty dialog, and the sense that something larger and more meaningful is about to happen at any moment.

Harry struggles with many things, such as adolescence, death, and school, and appears to be very angry in this installment. Following suite of the previous books, several issues are explained and brought to light to leave the reader feeling informed, yet in suspense for Rowling's next book in the series.  I liked that this book encompassed elements of all the previous books.

I found myself cheering for the guerilla style tactics of the D.A and everyone, including Hermione's total disregard for authority. Parallels between this section of the book can be drawn to Orwell's Animal Farm. You can see that with the insane amount of legislations banning this and that passing through the Ministry and directly affecting the students. The mood is generally dark, from the action packed beginning, to the absolutely adrenaline-pumping conclusion. However, the Quidditch matches with Ron as Keeper were generally amusing with the whole ""Weasley is our King.""

This book, although it does have it's lighter moments, is sort of depressing, largely because Harry is so out of character from the previous books.  Although this is obviously intentional as the author is trying to develop the character beyond the boy-hero of the previous books, the end result is that Harry comes across as not much of a hero at all.  Rather he becomes more of a victim, and even worse, in this book he seems to be his own worst enemy.  Of course, this is often true in real life, but who reads books like this to be reminded of real life problems?

I did have one small problem with this book, however. I thought it was put to too high of standards. People expected another J.K. Rowling masterpiece and I, personally, was a little let down by this book. Of course it was good, but it was not my favorite. I think it was missing something, but I can't put my finger on what.

"6313",5,731196,FALSE,"J.K. Rowling has figured out how to gracefully mature her writing style along with the characters of the latest Harry Potter adventure. I promised myself I would space out the reading of this new anxiously awaited book, but found myself staying up late to get to the next chapter. It started off slower for me; there was no Dursley fun and games (which I love in the other books) which changes the tone of this tome. This is not a story about 11 year olds anymore. The more serious teenager angst tone is a little unsettling at first but feels natural after the first 100 pages. This book, more than any of the others, really requires all the previous knowledge of its antecedents. This is a book for Harry Potter fans. It is not meant to be a stand alone read. J.K.Rowling does an exquisite job tying in all the details and clues without retelling things monotonously, as many series writers seem apt to do.

However, I finished reading it yesterday and I didn't enjoy it that much. The series has become formulaic and rather predictable. The adults act too stupid for words ,even Dumbledore whose explanations for his actions are so weak and full of holes...Too many flaws in the book and I was often bored reading the book.I even remember the first 4 books better than this one.At least the death scene wasn't grisly but at this point in the book I found most of the characters irritating and I wasn't sorry to see the person die. The annoying thing though is all the hype made in the media about JK Rowkings crying after she killed off this character.The book wasn't that bad, I'm just irritated about all the efforts made(JK Rowlings claims its to protect the children.

Rowling uses some standard plot developers and puzzle makers that she used previously but I must say that the final confrontations of the book were absolutely gut wrenching.  She does not reveal who dies until the very last moment and until then each of the main characters could have fallen victim.  That the death seems anti-climactic is a clever ruse.  It illustrates how one small mistake can cost a character their life in Rowling's world.  The way Harry P mourned the character who died was touching.  I felt that JK actually mourned as well.  Perhaps my only criticism of the characters would be directed to Umbridge.  Her ability to be duped in the novel was a bit too simplistic but, suspension of disbelief helped me ease through those passages.

The death scene was confusing and happened too quickly, and therefore did not move me at all. The character just seems too powerful to die in such an odd manner. If Harry had used the mirror the (now-dead) character gave him, he/she would still be alive. Also, I found Dumbledore's confession in the end to be utterly pointless. There were no clues that Dumbledore knew what was going on, only that he avoided Harry's eyes, which could mean *anything*. I thought the headmaster's LONG blurb was just the author's inability to come up with a satisfactory ending. I found her book filled with flaws and loop-holes that could've been solved in a smoother way.Finally, I felt that JK Rowling could've written more about Ron and Hermione's Prefect duties, and less about Harry's anger management. Regardless of her new title, Hermione would've stopped anything she deemed wrong since she is so righteous. Ron did nothing with his badge.Fred and George's character developed well, and so did Ginny's.

Howeevr, OotP did not need to be almost 900 pages long. A lot of the events were way too strtched out and it would hav been better if it was only 500 or 600 pages. Also, when Scholastic announced that Dumbledore was gonna reveal something to Harry, a lot of readers including myself expected something big, like being the Heir to Gryfondor, or something among that line. Dumbledores ""secret"" was a big let-down. And then of course there was the new Harry. Harry does not seem to be a angry person, and please don't give Hormones as an excuse. Hormones rage when you are 12, and 13 and we didn't see all of this anger then. THe book wasn't entirely bad though. Umbridge's character, the DA, and the Weasly twins new antics added to the plot.

Well for the most part, the action was intense and the story was well woven into the plot, but where was the surprises.In Goblet of Fire, we went through the entire book being surprised by Voldemort's unexpected return and Mad Eye Moody being a fraud. That was enough for me, the book is great, but I think it falls short to GoF o be honest.

I have to admit, that although it adds to the adversity that Harry has to overcome, and will probably make him stronger, i was saddened by the death of such an important character.

It was great to see many of Harry's classmates get much, much larger roles in this book, especially at the end. Rowling also spent a good amount of time dealing with Harry's personal life. My only real dissapointment is that the growing relationship between two of Harry's best friends (gee, can you guess who?), which received some attention in book 4, seems to have been put on the backburner here.

Yet as Harry realizes he must enter into this world without the total privledges of a full adult however with nearly all of the responsibilities of one.This is Harry's ""Empire Strikes Back"" journey, it is in this tale that he faces the grayness of good and evil and must affirm that reality. By doing so, he will rise from his anger and depression and find the extraordinary hero that we have already seen growing inside of him. The Harry in Book Six and Seven will no longer be the one who is merely ""watched over"" or ""guided to greatness"" he will be the one who is getting very close to taking total control over his own destiny.

There's no need to elevate to harsher language and it does nothing for the story.* It's just too long. Especially in the first half you can feel her stretching out the story for no reason.

Though it still has the mystery -- the dreams, that is -- it seems that the book is more focused on politics which may turn off some, but I found to be interesting.  In the end, I thought it was pretty solid.  I'll summarize.Bad points: Slow start.  The ""big"" death wasn't really *that* big or touching. I was really hoping for closure with the Snape / Potter hatred (save it for book 6/7 I guess).  I think the battle at the end would be better written without every paragraph starting with a magic word being shouted.  It got annoying to read ""EXPELLIRAMUS!"" and ""STUPEFY!"" every five words.

You do not have to read the first two to understand this book and the plot is very quick. harry is being pursued by Sirius Black, the man responsible for his parent's deaths. harry must come to terms with his own anger and find out a lot about his father's past.

I have had my nose stuck inside it at every opportunity since and just finished it this evening.  It was a wonderful enchanting story and J.K. Rowling's writing just gets better with every novel.If you are buying this for your child and haven't read the series yourself, do it soon!  From the very first one, though slightly simpler than the next 4, the books are amazing. I recommend them to adults and children everywhere. Definite must read material.",FALSE,2003,1469

It's a wonderous new journey into Harry's world, a journey i hope to take again and again. Harry seems a lot angrier in this book, but that makes him even more realistic and teenager-like, and being a tenager myself (13 years old) I would know. Though it starts slow, all the pieces of the puzzle come together in a sad, yet fitting conclusion. The new characters are vivid, and you can learn to hate and love them, for their personality traits shine through. What made me truely happy was the return of some of my favorite characters (from especially the third book) in this, it made it tie into the others quite well.  There is no doubt that I would recomend this book to any Harry Potter fan, I was thuroughly satisfied by the results and glad I waited so long for a gem like this.

"6381",3,731189,FALSE,"So the 5th book is finally out.  I read the book in 6 hours and found it an enjoyable read but not the best of the series.  More of the action takes place away from Hogwarts this time and these sections show JK Rowling's limitations as an author.  There are a lot of new characters, some of which work but others fall flat.  The much hyped death in the book is very predictable, I had guessed who it was before I read the book and she overuses the mortal peril plot point to try to increase suspense which works to a degree but in the end the character she killed off was not minor but neither was it a major character plus she left an opening for that character to come back if she so wishes.  Overall I am surprised it took 3 years to write and though I enjoyed reading it I am not as anxious for the 6th to come out as I was the 5th, certainly the Goblet of Fire stands as not only the best book of the series but one of the best cliffhanger endings ever.

It's hard to tell the plot of a Harry Potter book, because so much goes on and then you start giving away things.  All I have to say about The Prisoner of Azkaban's plot is that Harry goes back for his 3rd year at Hogwarts and has to be extra careful because a prisoner has escaped from the maximum security prison, Azkaban.  That prisoner is said to be heading for Hogwarts and Harry.  I loved this book so much because of the mystery and suspense and all of it's plot twists.  J.K. Rowlings is a GREAT writer.

I was afraid that Rowling might have been losing her touch after reading the disappointing (but still enjoyable) GOBLET OF FIRE, but I was quite wrong. Rowling brilliantly manipulates the emotions of the reader so that you sympathize with the characters throughout the novel.In regard to previous reviews which stated the the book was labored and unneccisary, I can only guess as to the reasons for the harsh criticism. Perhaps the book was a bit too complex for them (as I said, it isn't a kiddie read). They obviously did not understand the symbolism in the later chapters. But for anyone who is interested in reading a dark spellbiner, I strongly suggest HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX.",FALSE,2003,1486
"6385",4,730045,FALSE,"Let's get the good stuff out of the way first.  Harry Potter is the ugly duckling who turns out to be a swan.  He's easy to like.  He brave, kind and generous.  He's open minded and loves to learn.  He is not vain about  his celebrity or snobbish about his special gifts.  When he has the chance,  he chooses not to kill the man who betrayed his parents to their deaths.  He has a strong inborn sense of good and evil, and he knows what side he's  on.  That's a good thing, because in many ways Harry Potter has the  potential to be a somewhat dangerous example. Harry is, first of  all, a born member of a secret elite.  Like all wizards and witches, he  knows he is superior to the surrounding world of muggles, who don't know  what's really  going on and must never be allowed to know.  Nice wizards  like the Weasleys view muggles with a sort of superior amusement at the  clumsy way they have to do things.  This attitude is taught at Hogwarts --  Hermione, who has two muggle parents herself,  has to do a paper for her  Muggle Studies class on ""Why Muggles Need Electricity.""  Nasty wizards,  like the Malfoys, are a lot worse.  They view muggles with contempt, as not  really human.  All wizards agree that it would be a very dangerous thing if  the muggles ever found out about what wizards and witches can do.  Most of  the work of the Ministry of Magic seems to involve keeping them from  finding out.  So Harry finds himself on the right side of a world divided  into two groups - a small, smart  minority who know what actually happens,  and a vast, stupid and potentially dangerous minority -- think Durseleys --  who live in a world of illusions. Hermione's inner life, by the way,  would make a fascinating story.  Unlike Harry, her real parents are  muggles.  How they and others like them are persuaded to send their  children to Hogwarts, where they get the galleons to pay for tuition and  school supplies in Diagon Alley, and why they don't tell all the other  muggles all about it are  never really explained.  As muggle born (the ugly  expression is ""mudblood""), Hermione is subject to a certain amount of  prejudice from bad people like Draco Malfoy.  Because she's smart, she  tries to overcome it and fit in by learning everything there is to know  about being a witch, as if getting the top marks will really make her an  insider.  She's miserable when her book learning doesn't make her friends  with born wizards and witches.  Although she fights with Ron Weasley, he  wants so much to be friends with him because Ron is from a big, happy, pure  wizard family and comfortable being a wizard without being a snob about it.  I would bet Hermione is always nervous about how she's doing and always  afraid that something is going to go wrong for her.  She think's her only  protection is to be perfect, and nobody's perfect - least of all at 13.  But back to Harry.  He was raised as a muggle, but he's a natural wizard  and a born superstar.  He's also rich, which won't hurt either as he gets  older.  He was a celebrity before he even arrived at Hogwarts.  He's never  heard of Quidditch, but he turns out to be an exceptional player the first  time he picks up a broom.  Everyone thinks he will grow up to do  extraordinary things  As a result, he gets a lot of special treatment.  Gifts are showered on him by adult patrons and older students - hotshot  brooms, an Invisibility Cloak, the Marauder's Map.  He gets special  teaching from Dumbledore, from Lupin, and even from Hagrid.  Only Professor  Snape and Malfoy don't like him, and that's because they're both jealous.  Hogwarts itself comes easily to Harry.  If it wasn't for his grown-up  enemies who are out to get him, he wouldn't have any real problems in his  life at school. It's how Harry solves his real problems that's  disturbing.  Because he is who he is - the  the predestined enemy of the  fearsome Voldemort -- Harry is treated both by the author and his fellow  characters as if he were above the law.  He constantly breaks school rules.  He sneaks into places where he is forbidden to go.  He conceals important  facts from his teachers, including Dumbledore.  To do so, he flat out lies.  He puts the lives of other students at risk.  He helps the hippogriff and  Sirius Black escape the death sentences imposed by the Ministry of Magic.  In every crisis Harry breaks the rules and defies adult authority to follow  his own judgment - and he teaches Hermione that she should do the same.  The faithful Ron, of course,  follows him without question.  He is always  forgiven because he is right and the rules, his teachers (except for the  all-knowing Dumbledore) and the government are wrong.  Not only does  Dumbledore forgive and reward him; by The Prisoner of Azkaban, Dumbledore  is conniving with him against the Minstry. So Harry teaches his  young readers that if you're somebody really special (and who isn't), you  know better than most of the adults who tell you what to do, and you should  trust your own judgment and do what's right, not what you're told.  The few  really wise adults will agree with you and help you out.  The adults who  get in the way are likely to be fools, like Snape, or fakes like Lockhart  and Trelawney, or bullies, like Malfoy's father, or cowardly weaklings,  like most of Voldemort's followers seem to be.  It never hurts an author to  flatter her audience, and I suspect that a fair number of Harry's fans are  learning some interesting moral lessons about the world and their place in  it.",FALSE,2000,324

I just can't imagine that *anyone*, including Harry, would be surprised by the prophecy revealed at the end of the book.Don't let that negative bit about the ending keep you from reading this book though.

At his aunt and uncle's house (where he dreads it the most). He accendentally blew up his second aunt Marge. She started to blab about how bad Harry is, but it wasn't such a smart thing to do.

This book is unnecessarily long.  It's as though Rowling was told by her marketing strategists that somehow a heftier offering would equate to a heftier credibility.Next the book is dominated by repetitious and trite phrases.  My personal favorite is ""screwed up his eyes..."" Use it once, okay.  Use is several times, over and over again, as Rowling does in Order of the Phoenix and it definitely gets in the way.Finally, Rowling really offers nothing new in this latest volume and we see her straining to keep the tale going.

Rowling still manages to make the story the best in the series yet.However, I would like to warn some that Harry is getting older, and therefore the story becomes a bit more mature, with a bit more strong language, but the book is still a classic.As further proof of the book's greatness, I would like to share that the reading time for each book keeps getting shorter!

The first half of the book takes place in Grimauld Place, an abandoned old house where Sirius Black, Harry's godfather, lives. During their visit, Harry finds out that Voldemort is after him and that wizards have been watching him everywhere he went.The second half is about how Harry finds out a bout the prophacy created when he was born and decides to go out looking for it.

Rowling Do you ever feel like your alone and you don't know what's going on? People you're close to known, but they're not telling you anything. Have you ever felt like this? Well, 16 year old Harry felt this way all summer. Harry, who loves with his muggle (non-magic) Aunt and Uncle, had to sneak around their house trying to hear the news to see if anything bad in the magical world had happened. Most importantly, to see if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was back in power like he heard about. All summer long, Harry wondered this. When Harry went back to school, he found that most of his friends read mean things about him in the Daily Prophet. His friends thought they were true, so they didn't talk to him. School was terrible. They got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who has a personality like poisoned honey. She despised Harry so she did every thing to make his life terrible by giving him a lot of detentions and kicking him off the quidditch team. During Harry's 5th year, he keeps getting haunting dreams of a door at the end of a silent corridor. What does it mean? Is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named staying at the school or making so kind of plans? Harry wonders all this, but doesn't get any answers. Not until a week before the end of term, by Professor Dumbledore. Because of this, Harry finds depth and strength in his friends, beyond what even he knew, boundless loyalty, and unbearable sacrifice.

In the characters' fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry they are bombarded with challenges they never expected; Harry almost gets kicked out of school, gets kicked off the Quidditch team and has the worst series of detentions ever.  With all these roadblocks in the Ron, Harry and Hermione's way, how can the trio not change? Harry seems to have gone down for the worse. With his reoccurring dream of going down a long hallway, the young man seems more paranoid than ever. He even continually snaps at his best friends for doing nothing. Ron and Hermione are the stars now as Prefects and Ron replacing team captain Oliver Wood as Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.  It seems to be the hardest year ever for Harry who not only has the all-important O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Level exams) as well as his ever-going battle with Lord Voldemort. Plus he is helping his old crush Cho Chang deal with the death of her ex-boyfriend who Harry carried back from his tournament last year.  The book still carries the magical charm and enchantment of the past books but something is different in this book. The books have gotten darker as the children have grown up. The settings are still beautiful and the humor still light but still an evil lingers at Hogwarts.  Among the evil things is the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor (a new position created by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge because of his disliking of Professor Albus Dumbledore and the way he Head Masters the School) Delores Umbridge. She not only does all this but also is so nosey and impossible you have to think she must be the biggest ""witch"" in the world.  The lurking danger of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named as always is upon Harry and the gang. They even starts a Defense Against the Dark Arts club (after clubs have been banned by Umbridge who doesn't teach them anything anyway) called Dumbledore's Army.  The book is still exciting but it definitely isn't the old Harry, Ron and Hermione I used to know. The book was slightly disappointing with a twisty ending. The series is starting to take a more serious turn and I'm not sure I want the characters to grow up. I still want them to be the little goofy 11 year olds they were in the first book still scared, unknowing and experimenting.  It was not the best book in the series but still good. It definitely could have been cut down. It's mostly children who read the series and it's going farther and farther away from its original audience.

Dudley seems to have discovered a few brains now, and his thickness was after all what we all enjoyed.Harry's frequent rages seem to be a little OTT. Yes he has been left on his own all summer, and does not know the extent to which Voldemort's powers have grown throughout the holiday, but then neither do Ron and Hermione either, and they don't erupt into rages all the time. Ok Harry is a teenager, but then I am 19 and I didn't have temper tantrums at his age.Harry's stay at Grimmauld Place is way too long. Do we really need to know how filthy Sirius Black's place had got, and how diligently Harry & co cleaned it? Do we need to know what Mrs Weasley fears the most? Or that Ron was nearly strangled by some robes in a cupboard? No. So we finally get to Harry's trial re: underage use of magic (finally, an interesting piece), but then we're back to Grimmauld Place again...Finally we get to Hogwarts.

Yes this is meant to be written for children, but other authors eg Philip Pullman and Philip Reeves write more gruesome deaths for their child audiences.)...the unveiling of an unsurprising prophecy, and the usual chat with Dumbledore after the fight.The end of the fight scene is somewhat unsatisfying, as too many loose ends are suddenly tied together in the Dept of Mysteries with no clear information given. After the fight, we see a weak Dumbledore, that is as shocking to the audience as it is to Harry himself. Who wants to see a fallible Dumbledore? Harry's rage towards his headmaster is rather unlikely. I am sure that if I were act that way to one of my headteachers, I would be expelled on the spot or forcibly removed from the room. There was no real reason for Harry to be so angry at Dumbledore. Ok he has been ignored by him for the past year or so...but come on, Dumbledore is the headteacher of a large and prestigious school, and Harry is just one 15-yr old pupil that his staff are teaching. Yes Harry did see Voldemort resurrected...but that is no reason why headmaster and pupil should suddenly have a cozy chat every day.

I don't want to spoil the book for everyone, but I will say that there is enough action and adventure in it to satisfy even the pickiest of readers. I found that some of the old characters, and most of the new ones, were well thought out and very entertaining. This novel brings in a lot of new adventures and characters...but I, for the most part, find that the author does a lot of explaining and ellaborating on old characters, events, and incidents.Anyways, for the person who is a fan of Harry Potter, this should be THE item on your list of things to buy for the summer.

"6544",4,731264,FALSE,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, a book to quench the thirst of any Harry Potter fan, is an excellently plotted book, but the writing was different. J.K. Rowling's style of writing seems to have changed greatly when compared with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, not in its paragraph length, but in its preciseness. Before she would have said ""He left to get the drinks, paying for them himself. When he tasted it, it warmed him to his fingertips."" If she had written that now, she would probably describe how he walked away, paid, walked back, and given the drinks. The plot elements were interwoven in a traditional way, but the writing needed to be shortened. Though very good, it needed some work.",FALSE,2003,1543

She captures her readers attention by bringing them into a world, that seems to be more real then the one we are living in now, and enchanting them with another tale of the struggle against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Even though the fifth book tends to be darker, and much longer then the other books, I am astounded by how humorous some chapters are. Harry, who seems to no longer be haunted by his parents death, has gained more of an egotistical look on life, yet still manages to make readers fall in love with him. Overall, I believe that this book is the best of the Harry Potter series yet and am excited for the next installment.",FALSE,2003,1469

I thought that there was a MUCH larger emphasis on how Harry does in school then in all of the other four books combined. I also thought that the book was held together by a much thinner plot then the other books, especially the fourth one. In the Order of the Phoenix, Harry is having sporadic dreams about an unusual hallway with a mysterious door.  Once Harry finally gets to this part of the book, the action happens way too fast and is over too quickly for a 770 page book.However, once it gets going, it is really good!

I noticed in this book though that Harry seemed like a darker character, not so upbeat anymore, I guess not a child anymore.  Harry's darkened attitude seemed to foreshadow the upcoming events and choices he made in the story and the fact that he and Voldemort are more connected than anyone realized.  I have to say I thouroughly enjoyed this novel.  The drama is definitely unfolding at Hogwarts and in Harry's life and it will take the last two books of the series to conclude this amazing story.

He was a villain whose one redeeming quality was--er--dogged loyalty to Harry.  Doesn't go very far in with me.  I think this was an error on Rowling's part.  Maybe her intent was to teach Harry a lesson by the parallel story with Sirius (raised in a horrible home, could've been Slytherin but with Gryffindor tendencies, loyal and with good values but also full of rage, locked up for his own protection, last of the family...etc...etc). Unfortunately, Harry doesn't seem to have picked up on the lesson. Neither will most readers. I imagine it was something like, ""We have to learn to control our dark sides?""

Of course the dream was the plot but it wasn't like the plots of the other books where it was there through the whole book, strong and obviously the plot.  I have a feeling that these sub plots really will tye into future books but the lack of a strong center hurt my overall feelings of the book.I still loved this book and it ranks in at number two in the series (Azkaban being #1).

It was good that he was so moody because it was realistic. and even though it's longer, it shows a lot of feeling so it's easier to relate to Harry.

This horror is the long anticipated, and denied, return of the ominous Lord Voldemort, the greatest wizard in the world next to professor Dumbledore. In this fifth book of J.K. Rowling's ingenious series, Harry and his fellow fifth years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are going through the transition from children to teenagers, and all the emotional and physical changes that come with it. We start the book with a very gloomy Harry, who is quite irritated of his deprivation of news from the wizarding world, receiving very vague letters from his best friends, Hermione and Ron, by owl post at his aunt and uncles home in Little Winging. He feels that he should be informed of what's happening, where is Voldemort, what is everyone doing about it, and why couldn't he, the one who fought Voldemort in person last year, be a part of the effort to let the not to willing public accept Voldemort's return, rather than being stuck with his dreadful relatives. Due to an unexpected and very unusual attack from a pair of Dementors (The wizarding prison ""Azkaban"" guards) Harry is transported to Headquarters, where The Order of the Phoenix Members hold there meetings, and just so happens to be the former house of Black, and Sirius, Harry's escapee Godfather's home. Although his outlook is slightly improved, Harry is still irked about his separation from any news, even with the thought of shortly returning to Hogwarts to begin his fifth year. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are soon introduced to a new Hogwarts, one where there is a great deal of ministry control. Rather than having ministry officials crawling over the school, Cornelius Fudge (minister of magic) has placed one particularly awful and officious woman, Professor Umbridge. As time goes by, Umbridge begins to dominate over the teachers by becoming the Hogwarts High Inquisitor, and introducing a number of decrees insuring her reign over the school, for instance, no school meetings without her permission, and more authority than ""common"" teachers. Harry experiences plenty of losses in this book, including the death of the only person he could talk to and truly call family. His Godfather, Sirius Black. This novel is very well written. In Rowling's fresh writing style, I find that I can really relate to all the characters, being about the same age and feeling the same things. The book can make me feel frustrated, jovial, annoyed, and bewildered, and I catch myself having to remember that I'm not actually Harry, Ron, or Hermione.

People complaining that the book is too long, or that it's too depressing ect. Get over it people. You should no JK Rowling has something big planned for the end and so this is all necassary to continue the story.Voldemort is back so of course there's going to be a lot of bad stuff happening, and a lot of people dying, including characters that we care about.

Harry and his two best friends, Ron and Hermoine, suffer through many frightening experiences throughout their stay at Hogwarts (the wizardy shcool).  By gaining more and more information throughout their shcool year, they realize that this dark wizard is actually not after them. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone of any age.

""Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix"" arrives with more mind twisting mysteries, heart-pounding sensations, darker unbearable secrets, and new hormonal/adolescent anger.Harry Potter returns to his fifth year at Hogwarts after spending one more filthy summer at the Dursleys'. After having a near-death encounter with Voldemort in the previous year, Harry is going crazy that the wizard world is still calm and ignoring Harry's declarations of Voldemort's return. Not only that, he has nothing but sour feelings for his ""supposed"" friends Ron and Hermione, who have distanced themselves from Harry without contact.After having clearer and clearer dreams of walking through dark corridors, Harry is kept on the edge of his bed, and realizes that something dark and mysterious is happening, involving you-know-who and his return. Yet Harry has no clue, and is dying to know about it, and some weapon that the Order of the Phoenix, an anti-Death-Eater organization, is preparing.As the story bypasses, you'll come across some previous characters, like Remus Lupin and Alastor Moody, the previous Defense-against-Dark-Arts professors. However, you'll meet new characters, including a new Defense-against-Dark Arts teacher who will probably make you feel like leaping into the middle of the story and give her a smack or two on her toad-like wide-lipped face.Also, the Hogwarts fifth-years will put their five years of magical education to the test on the dreadful Ordinary Wizarding Level Exams. Plus, more enchanting secrets will be revealed after years of curiosity, like why Professor Snape has always disliked Harry and his father for no apparent reason.Harry will have to encounter many hardships in this sinister year. For one, he is exposed to his sacred destiny in life, and his romance with a certain person goes bad. Speaking of things going bad, the Ministry of Magic and its minister really seem to be losing their touch; the minister, Cornelius Fudge, makes the most ignorant decisions that it makes it seem like an ape is running the place.Well, still J.K Rowling is a very truly talented writer who seems a lot like Rita Skeeter, who just grabs her quill, and can make the book hang on to your hands for dear life and never let go, because readers will not want to put this book down.",FALSE,2003,1468

"6729",3,731475,FALSE,"I have always read HP with the eager expectation of what magical events will be revealed with the new book. Rowling did not disappoint me, each time conjuring so much fantasy mixed with the school day reminiscience. It felt good, to be back in a fictional elementary school with adventure and magic, surely everybody's dream adventure rather than having to practice boring arithmatics or reading social studies text books!I can see that Rowling made lot of painful effort to make the book perfect. It has, indeed, tight structure and plot that makes the thick book quite seamless. Every chapter and every conversation are indeed linked to the forthcoming events, and indeed every character fits in compactly to overarching storyline. But it no longer has that magic glitter that makes our eyes blink with awe.The story should have tried to stick to Hogwarts. Too much story takes place outside the realm of that magical school, which still seems to have lots of secrets! Why do we need to venture into Grimauld Place, Ministry of Magic or St. Mungo's? Notice a stretch Rowling goes to try to connect all those places, with fireplace communication, on-leave from Dumbling, or thestrals.The story was more fit if Hogwarts was left out completely. It just does not fit with the fifth year students trying to ward of Death Eaters. I almost felt sorry for Rowling who had to write the fighting scenes in the Ministry where spells were depicted rather like a laser blast in a Star Wars movie.It's always the childhood memories that can work magic with, well, the magic and fantasy. The story of Minister, Hospital, and much adults no longer makes that possible. What was once a magical story glossed with a touch of modernity has now been reversed, a thoroughly modern story with a whipping cream of magic. It is always possible that there can be more magic. But perhaps, the spell of childhood magic that Rowling is so capable of entertaining us has lost the charm. What if another Rowling would take over from this point who can wield, yet, another more-grown up magic more fitting for the Great Wizard of Harry Potter.Just some of the memorable moments were the thestrals, Snape's past, and the stories of giants.

The corruption in the Ministry of Magic is evident from the beginning and plays an important role in the way the book evolves.

This one, however, it went deeper into thier characters then before, focusing more on what they think, and feel. It was a whirlwind of a ride, though!There is so much more that happens in the book that makes it darker then the others, that makes Harry seem a lot older in the book.

If you, as a reader, loves an exciting page-turner, than this is the book for you. Harry Potter and the Order of the phoenix will have you on the edge of your seat at all times. This book is a fantasy that takes place in the modern times and in a Wizarding environment. It describes the very life style of a troubled teenage wizard (Harry Potter) and his best friends, Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger. Ron comes from a complete wizarding family, and Hermione is muggle-born (Which is a child that has not one drop of wizarding blood in their body). This is their fifth year at Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, they have a lot on their minds; such as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, whose voice is so sweet it would make you sick, end of the year exams, the Quitaddch cup, and a mysterious house elf. J. K Rowling had many good descriptions in the book and made the reader seem as if they were actually taking place in the story. She made Harry's dreams come alive and vivid, she had the quiddatch games come to life, and much much more. She also had humor, romance, and had a very up-beat story line.  Rowling's language and metaphors were also used frequently. She used metaphors when needing to explain the past in Harry's life or an event that took place. Such as when Harry wanted to know about the Order of the Phoenix and what his parents did for it, they told him in their terms what happened to his parents and how they contributed. To an extent. J.K Rowling wrote and explained her view of Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts as a narrator. The theme was what really made the reader want to never put down the book. It was realistic, fast-paced, and exciting. It had the reader diving into the pages and wanting to know what event took place next. This was exactly how I felt when reading the book. I never wanted to put it down for more than a second or when my parents insisted for me to go to bed. I loved the descriptions that were told and what Harry's life was like at Hogwarts.  One book from the same genre that I compared to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was The BFG by Raul Dahl. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix described a life of a teenage boy with low self-esteem and The BFG by Raul Dahl describes a little girl with a big imagination and high hopes for her dreams. Harry thought he would never feel safe in his life and was very insecure. In The BFG, the little girl felt like someday she would be safe and made sure she would have friends when she was older. Another book that I compared to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was Fever by Laurie Halse Anderson. Fever was a historical/ fiction book. It described how a disease swept people to their death and how people tried to escape it, but could not. Fever told a sad story about a girl and how each member of her family died one by one until she was left alone. Fantasy gives me more hope than fiction, so I would definitely prefer fantasy to fiction. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was one of the best books I have ever read. I loved everything about it and cannot wait for Rowling to continue with the series. It showed me how lucky I am to have loving parents and friends. Harry on the other hand had to live through his life with out his parents and had to make new friends as he moved on through life.

You'll find all these things in J.K Rowling books. Want more imfo on her boks read on because there is a lot more you need to know about this book!  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix( book 5) is my favorite book shes written. Harry gets sent to magic  court after he put a spell on a couple of Dementors! He is not allowed to do any spells away from his school, Hogwarts. This begins his 5th year which ends in great parolee and heart ache.  The theme is to never give up hope and don't lose faith in your self. Sense Harry had to not lose hope that he would go back to Hogawarts and he had to have a lot of faith. If he would have gave up hope and lost faith hewould have not gone back to Hogwarts his true home!  The reason she wrote this book is to keep the series going so she would be able to write more books on Harrys life. Also because some of the things are realated to  her life but not with magic and some of the characters are real people that she remembers and wants to add their personality.  A quote she once said is"" Fear of a name increases fear of the thing its self"". The reason its significant is because she puts that in her books to let people know that if you don't say Lord Voldemort a evil wizard name and your not scared of him your just a coward. Voldemort killed Harrys parents for not becoming his servents.  I recommend this book to boys and girls 5th grade and above. Also adults of all ages because its great for most adults.",FALSE,2005,2183

For example, it says more about why Voldermort attacked Harry, gave information on Snape, explained much of the past, ect.  This book shows a more mature and grown up Harry.  He begins to ask extremelity interesting questions.  If one is only for action, the middle to end of book does this for you, but it is very intriquing on how Harry and the reader recieves answers to many questions we have all been asking.  I recommend with all my might that you purchase and read this book.  More activities are O.rdinary W.izarding L.evel exams, interaction between Harry and Dumbledore, and Harry's first love life.

This book will not only spark the intrest of children, but adults and teens will enjoy this book through all of its many twits and turns. If you are a parent deciding wheather or not to buy this book for your child, take in mind that this book is darker than the all of those previous. You may need to explain some of the parts to your child. I do not think, however, that you should denie your child the opportuity to read this novel.ENJOY",FALSE,2003,1470
"6802",4,731195,FALSE,"I finished this book 2 1/2 days later after its release. I loved it alot but thought that Rowling could have had a bit more cheerfulness inside. But I liked the way Harry got angry outburst which proved that he wasn't perfect (which many belive him to be). Also in the book we hear about Cho Chang, Harrys secret crush from the 4th book!!! I won't give anything away but they aren't as magnificent of a couple as you would think them to be! Also, the new DATDA teacher is simply HORRIBLE!!!!! I love the way Rowling describes her and could picture her perfectly. Hermione and Ron, I feel, are starting to grow apart from Harry. They are still ""The 3 Musketeers"" but fights start to become frequent and their differences (Hemione and Ron being prefects, ron not having 2 much money,studies) start to come between them. But I belive in the 6th book they will become wonderful friends again. I found the end sorta confusing. The chapter when Dumbledore tells Harry 2 sit down and he'll tell him ""everything"" wasn't as BIG as I thought it would be. I was thinking that maybe Harry might be Voldemorts brother or something but...thats not it. Percy turns ""Un-Weasly"" in this book.I think that hes 2 conceited that he thinks because he works for the minestry hes as important as Fudge himself. Also I love how they decide to teach theirselves the dark arts, which proves, even if it means getting expelled they are willing to do anything to learn-- AND get rid of Umpbridge. Also the Minestry of Magic, to me are the bad guys now. They seem to want to stop Dumbledore from wanting to free everyone of the Dark Lord. Aunt Petunia is beggining to be nice to Harry. She might be a witch herself!!! About the end of the book-*sob sob* i feel so sorry for Harry--Im sure everyone who read this does.:-( This book is packed with many different adventures-- its like tons of stories in one book! I could have rated it 5 stars but I felt that its a bit too gloomy and downhill. But its perfect if you love a good adventure and your crazy about Harry!!! Keep up the terrific books Mrs. Rowling!!!

"6804",3,730042,FALSE,"Harry Potter's third adventure at Hogwart's magical boarding school is fun to read aloud to one's children.  The weak plot and average literary quality of this book coincide with the previous adventures.Note:  Read  Jack Cerf's Amazon.com review, dated 21 February 2000, entitled ""a Few  Quibbles.""  Approaches character development from an interesting  perspective.Plot structure.  It appears that each successive book will  cover one year of Harry's growth and development at Hogwarts Academy.  So,  four to go.  This style requires delayed character development as the  self-discovery of our protagonist is tied to defeating the puppetlike  agents of an ultimate evil;  one who adult wizards fear to the point where  they won't utter his name.  A 13- year-old amateur wizard is supposed to  lead the struggle against this threat to the Wizard and Muggle worlds?  An  entire Ministry of Magic cannot marshall its considerable magical talents  against this menace?  Or is Rowling illustrating the indecisiveness and  pettiness of bureacracies?Each book describes Harry's self-discovery.  Unlike real children, he learns his family history sporadically from his  friends, his teachers, and his enemies.  The role of inheireted talent and  worthiness rings hollow, though it is a common plot device. (See Tolkein's  Aragorn for a more fully developed version)His abusive foster family is  a bit harsh for children's books, however accurately it may portray some  foster homes.  Rowling has taken a page from Dahl, though she comes off as  heavy-handed in her treatment of the Dursley family.Harry's noble nature  contrasts with American psychobabble, whose model would have him emerge as  a vicious and hateful person, due to his unloving family, coupled with his  lack of a positive role model.  Is Rowling's message that  school can act  as mitigation for inept parenting?  More real is Harry's propensity for  ""going underground"" to achieve his ends, a survival skill he  would develop in the Dursley household.Other gripes?  The use of the  magical ""Sorting Cap"" to prejudge students is an artless parody  of the ""halo"" effect and self-fulfilling prophecies.  The use of  the overworked adjectives ""cool,"" ""cold,"" and  ""stupid"" shows the author's limited descriptive power.  Her  characters are constructed as eccentricities embodied in human flesh.  One  hopes that as ""Harry"" ages, he will see people-- and the  characters will be developed-- with greater depth to reflect how people  grow in understanding others as they mature.Good stories need well  constructed antagonists.  Unfortunately, Voldemort is generally off stage,  and constrained to use clownlike surrogates to fulfill his aims: a poorly  disguised adaptation of the Satanic archetype.  With luck, the  ""struggle"" story element will get better treatment in future  editions of this serial.A point possibly lost on young readers is the  incestuous mini-world that the private school archetype devolves into at  Hogwarts, reflecting the ""school tie"" mafia pervading Britain's  white collar and business world.  The extension of school relationships  into adult life is a gross caricature of how it plays out in reality.The  fun?  Comic relief provided by Fred and George Weasley, whose spirit  accurately captures that of many private school alumni who combat  repression with practical jokes.  Also fun are the Quidditch matches that  take the imagination into three dimensional frames of reference, and  illustrate nicely how arbitrary the rules of popular sports can be.  If you  read the Rules of Golf, you'll see how simple Quidditch is.Whilst  entertaining, the story is hardly great literature a la C.S. Lewis or Rhold  Dahl, or M. L'Angel.  At least The Prisoner of Azkabahn provides some  insights into characters' inner conflicts.  Hernmione's lesson on trying to  live on borrowed time is a good use of ""magic"" to illustrate a  modern problem.  Unfortunately, the ""surprise"" ending and the  plot devices used to create it are beyond my ability to suspend disbelief.  Less discriminating readers and pre-adolsecents--the target audience-- may  overlook that shortcoming.Overall, this story is worth a look, and  certainly fun to read aloud to one's children.",FALSE,2000,321

The Order of the Phoenix, however, was a great disappointment compared to The Goblet of Fire.  Though it was descriptive, it lacked a good plot.  There was no point for the author to kill off Sirius Black -- the character had not yet been developed to his full potential.  We had not yet had the opportunity to feel for the loss of the character as much as we could have if it had been one of Harry's friends who had died.  It was also a sad thing that JK Rowling did with Harry & Cho Chang.  The author never developed Cho's character enough for us to care if Harry ended up dating her or not.

I even went back to Book 4 from time to time to remind myself of why things in 5 were the way they were.

I was REALLY happy that  this book revived the wonderful feeling I'd had in reading the first book!  However, I would recommend this series now to young adults and adults  instead of children since, at 300+ pages, the length might be overwhelming  for the average child reader.

It is a typical rebellious teen additude of feeling left out because now more than ever he feels that he can contribute to the ""Cause"" as an equal. Unfortunatly Harry is still treated like a kid which only angers him futher. For those that have watched Star Wars, this is the Empire Stikes Back of the series.

I think it's really a good thing that Rowling has decided to give Harry more negative things to deal with because it keeps the plot interesting.  She shows a more negative side to Harry as well, which makes it a lot more realistic (as realistic as a scarred wizard boy can be) for the audience.  The book also leaves you with a lot of questions, which is definitely good for selling the 6th book in the series.  I got it at midnight last night (June 21st) and stayed up until 4 am reading it.

Harry's constant whining and impatience cause him to make poor decisions the entire book, typical of a 15 year old boy.  Rowling's prose is much better than the last book.  For the most part, Order of the Phoenix avoided the passive tense that plagued Goblet of Fire.  My only gripe is that at 870 pages, Order of the Phoenix had too many subplots.  If Rowling were to have just eliminated one, the book would have been considerably shorter.

First of all, I would like to say that I didn't mind the length.  But reading about Harry's relationship with Cho is boring and not true to life.The master stroke is Dolores Jane Umbridge.  Dolores means pain in Latin, and that is what she is.  I think the one think kids can relate to in this book is the portrayal of unsympathetic, rigid, deluded, dogmatic authority figures who won't listen to what you have to say, even if (and especially if) it is the truth.  The conflict between Dumbledore and the Ministry was very real- you could feel it.But I couldn't feel Harry's pain when he suddenly transformed into a whiny, angsty teenage brat.  Harry acting in stereotypical ""teenage"" ways is not something real teenagers can relate to at all.  Normal people do not react to things like Harry does in this book.  One scene in particular when he shouts, in all capitals, for almost a page at Ron and Hermione, whom he has not seen for four weeks, was almost intolerable.  Another one in Dumbledore's office was just as bad.Overall, it had many exciting moments and great new characters, in particular Umbridge and Bellatrix (even though she was kind of in the 4th one).

Maybe in the next book, he will be more composed.It would take a person who just likes to be a critic to say that Black is going to come back again. People are just trying to degraid Rowling because of their dissatisfaction, and they think that because they were dissatisfied, everyone else will be too, and who ever isn't needs to be convinced that it was a bad book. There are all these critics out there complaining about the book, and it's uncanny how similar they seem to the sightless nitwit public who read and believe the bogus in the wizard newspaper, and have to put there input in, just to feel like they had an important say in things.Like I said, the books are just getting more realistic as far as the characters go. When kids become teenagers, they have tantrums, and they curse a little. But the book isn't so bad with cursing that a kid can't read it.Critics need to pull their heads out of their hind ends and look at the practicality of the books. It's obvious that the fifth book is probably a build-up for the last part of the story. Everything about Harry's strange life is explained. Now that everyone knows more stuff, the story can go on. Harry has a purpose now, revealed by the prophesy, and that is the beginning of the climax for the whole story.

I always find the books absorbing, because there is always stuff in there that I find that I didn't before. That is the mark of a good book, one that you can read over and over again. I'm anxious to see what happens now that Black is gone. Will Harry avenge him on his killer? What about quidditch? I have to admit that I was disappointed with Harry's banning from the sport, but I know that he will not be banned any more in his next year, because Umbridge is gone.

Also, Harry attempts to delve into the advanced magic of Occlumency (to block Lord Voldemort from controlling him), and because of his failed efforts one of his closest companions dies.  Also, Harry's relationship with Cho Chang takes numerous twists as he finds her very emotional about things he doesn't understand.

Potter relationship, as well as some insights into the OWL testing and what it's like to be a prefect.Harry is a lot angrier in this book, something that is classic 15 year old, but sometimes annoying to read about.

I mean, yeah, the part when Sirius died was pretty emotional, but in the other books they don't really talk to much about him, so you don't know to much about him; so that part wasn't as good as I would have liked it to be.

In effect their lives are becoming harder and more complicated especially now that Voldemorts back. If you've read all four of the Potter series you have to read this book.

For one thing, Harry is a bit too good at verbal attacks and defences, which makes me uncomfortable. More unsettling is Harry's ""dark"" subconscious tendencies. How could he use an Unforgivable Curse to inflict pain to others as if he's got a natural reflex to use it? I think he is so stubbornly arrogant to people he doesn't like (Snape for example), shallow (see how he deals with Cho and Dumbledore) and selfish (his temper is a sign of his self-centerness - he thinks he is always right) that he is starting to resemble the adolecent Tom Riddle.

Harry was extremely moody, not that I could blame him, he's been through a lot, but where is the Harry from books 1-4? Besides Harry's attitude problem the rest of the cast was great!

Then what do we get?  Another mass of colorfully-drawn, interesting enough characters, but no depth.  No building upon years of speculation.  Why should I bother to love Luna or Tonks or Kingsley when I can be pretty darn sure I'll never learn anything more about them?  Even Ron remains rather one-dimensional, and I'd rather hear about him in depth than about 5 new characters with clever names.On the other hand, angry Harry was great--it seemed very real.(...)Umbridge I loved-to-hate, and having worked for NASA, I can easily believe in the corrupt and incompetent Ministry.So: 2 stars for metaphor, one for just rockin' good storytelling, but none for characterization.

The first four books, left with a sense of triumph as Harry won over The-one-that-must-not-be-named. This one is totally unique in a sense that it is very much human.

There is a lot of explaining of... well... the unexplained. But there isn't a whole lot of action until the last few chapters.

I personally feel that this book is in keeping with the continuing spiral of development we've seen in Harry in the past 4 books. We've seen what he can and can't do, what pushes his buttons and what doesn't and how much grief he can tolerate and what he can't. It took J.K. Rowling 4+ years to come out with Book 5.

Is there any proof that magic is hurting children? No, there isn't. Harry Potter is a wonderful and enchanting book about a school of witchcraft and wizardry. There is an evil wizard named Voldemort who has been trying to kill Harry since birth. As the plot thickens in these 7 magical books, it takes you to a many wonderful places that teach you about witchcraft, friendship, and life. In these books Harry grows older and starts to deal with the issues of a normal teenage boy. While this book is a touch surreal, it also gives a very down to earth and personal feeling. Many of the issues Harry faces are issues that teenagers face today. Harry lives in an enchanted castle where they learn to make things fly and turn teapots into tortoises.

It's long and drawn out, and although there is major suspense leading to the end, it doesn't lead to much.I'm giving it three stars because it is still entertaining.  I was only bored at the very beginning.  After the first 10 chapters or so, things get quite interesting.  There is a lot of suspense, there are funny parts, and other things that you expect to find in a Harry Potter book.  But overall, it is not up to par with the other books in the series.

It just sort of happened, lackluster.Harry's anger bothered me.  He was whiney and cranky as another reviewer mentioned.  Overall, there just wasn't a lot of excitement in the first 800 pages.

I realize that this will probably be an unpopular review of this much anticipated book, but I think J.K.

They are not epic fantasy; these stories just incorporate characters that one may see walking down the sidewalk on Halloween.  With characters named Dedalus Diggle, Mundungus Fletcher, and Mad-Eye Moody, and with the main villain named ""Lord Voldemort,"" one may come to question the nature of the plot.  Does Rowling expect anyone to take it seriously?  A wizard named Voldemort seeks to conquer the ""wizarding world.""  And all these wizards manage to keep themselves secret from the ""muggles.""  And while the British publisher made ""adult"" copies of the book, most of the readers are children.  And the mass hysteria surrounding the new movies and toys is an embarassment.  If you are capable of reading a book as long as Order of the Phoenix, then put the time to better use by reading some of Tolkien's works, which are true epic fantasy and whose ideas weren't pulled off of the Halloween sidewalk.

I think the author has shrewdly carved out a series that will be identified by a certain age of readers and will bring fond memories when they look back at the common thread in their reading lives.The book continues to carry the wit and endearing themes of friendship and comraderie in this fifth installment of Harry's adventures at the school.The best scene would have to be....oh wait, i can't say....you'll just have to find out yourself!",FALSE,2003,1467

Not only does this book have these, but it also has plenty of surprises and a sort of dark and brooding Harry as he deals with Cedric's death, which is something readers have never seen before. Some readers may not like this new Harry, but I thought it was interesting to see this new side and helped to put Harry's persective into place. But of course, this is just my opinion and yours may be the total oppisite. Anyways, to try and summerize what I'm trying to say: this is a truly enjoyable book and a great read for anyone. Bravo Ms. Rowling!",FALSE,2003,1482
"7101",2,731197,FALSE,"First I would like to note that i thoroughly enjoyed the first four Harry Potter novels.The new Harry Potter installment was far too long and drawn out .  I felt like the book could have been written in 500 pages easily and have been more enjoyable.  Entire chapters that are very trivial and usually disconnected from the story are scattered often throughout the book.  The only thing in the first 700 pages of the book connecting to the anti-climactic conclusion was a recurring dream of Harry's.  I never felt surprised in the novel and the character death had little effect on me.  Also Harry's attitude throughout nearly the entire book is that of a whining, slef-pitying brat, which gets very annoying and impossible to enjoy the book.",FALSE,2003,1476
"7103",5,731189,FALSE,"I was indeed one of those people who waited until midnight at a bookstore in anticipation. And let me tell you, it was worth it. After finishing the book in 15 hours, I was on the edge of my bed wishing the 6th book came out tomorrow. As many of you have heard, someone dies in this book. Personally, he was my favorite character and somewhat of a father to Harry. That's all I'm saying. J.K. Rowling (the author) gives us definite variety in this book, as Harry is, for once, not the hero. Once again, as soon as Harry gets off the Hogwarts train for summer, you wish there was another one taking him back to Hogwarts. Many suprises and twists in this book. You might be very confused throughout the book, however it all comes together in the end.",FALSE,2003,1468
"7104",2,731255,FALSE,"I admit that I'm biased.  I love reading fantasy books, but only so long as I can respect the characters contained within.  To this day, I have had many reasons to not respect Harry Potter as a character, though precious few to not respect Hermione Granger, and not a single reason to not respect Albus Dumbledore.Then I read this book, and now, I will never respect him again.Albus Dumbledore is still a wizard of the highest order in this book, and he still seems fairly intelligent, but my professional respect for him has dipped a great deal.There is no fictional character that I respect more than Jean Luc Picard, of Star Trek; The Next Generation, and the reason why is that he always knows how to exercise his authority, and when to stand up to a higher-ranking official and say ""enough is enough.  I'll take no more of this.""Albus Dumbledore displays, in this book, an uncharacteristic lack of the ability to do this, as do Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Trelawney and surprisingly, the one man who was once the sole champion of no-nonsense, Professor Snape.90% of this book is spent watching a weak little bugger called Umbridge tormenting everyone and everything, (including the reader, seeing it from Harry's perspective,) as she marches into school and legislates her way into absolute power over Harry's world to more efficiently torment.  Now, I think people can agree with me that politicians are just about the most evil thing in the world, defying both human justice and natural selection, and Umbridge is a prime example of this.  You'll find yourself wondering why the heck, if nature is governed by survival of the fittest, she is still around!  You'll also be searching the chapter index over and over for a chapter entitled ""Umbridge gets hers.""Unfortunately, this book fails to deliver the bloody death of Umbridge, her employer, or in fact, anyone the reader has a reason to hate by the end of the book.  To cut a very, very long story short, good people die, wretched people live, and in the end, all the reader is left with is a feeling of strong irritation at Rowling for using her undeniably ingenious writing style to make them suffer.  Someone told me this book was darker than the others but... I just found it annoying myself.  Definitely the worst one in the series so far, or at least the least enjoyable, almost entirely devoid of both pleasure and tension.  It's like spending a whole year with the Dursleys.  If you like that sort of thing, you can read it if you want, but letting a kid read it won't help their psychological development.  Kids'll be better off reading something like ""The Princess and the Goblin"" or ""Alice in Wonderland"" that won't depress the pants off of them and make them see the world as a more wretched place to live than it obviously is.",FALSE,2003,1534
"7105",3,731194,FALSE,"I agree pretty much with the reviewer alpha3760 who wants to put Harry on Prozac. Perhaps JK Rowling wanted to make him a moody angst-ridden unpleasant self-absorbed teenage boy - whatever, she did for me. He's grown into a most unlikeable character: moody, rude and self-absorbed. I gave the book 3 stars because of the continuing imaginative tour de force that is the HP series. I'd like to see what happens next, but there was a lot about this book I did not enjoy, including the length - about 300 pages too long. The action took way too long to develop, and when it did it was a silly confused mess. The Umbridge character was so irritating as to make me almost want to put the book down. Lord Voldemort is looking like a sulky wimp, and as for the Death Eaters ... !!  But isn't it great that a 50+ year old is arguing this way about a ""kid's"" book?",FALSE,2003,1473
"7107",4,730073,FALSE,"I have read all three books to date. I have just finished the Prisoner of Azkaban. I have enjoyed them but felt that they do not compare to those fantasy stories written by Tolkien or Lewis. These books seem to have a few  problemsOne problem with these books is that they don't have that  enchanting feeling that one feels after having read, say, ""The Lion,  the Witch and the Wardrobe."" They don't seem to convey the redemptive  message that Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" conveys, and they lack  the epic feel of Tolkien's ""Hobbit"" or ""Lord of the  Rings"" Trilogy. When I finish a ""Potter"" book I feel  ""good,"" but I when I finish one of the ""Chronicles"" I  feel ""better.""These books are becoming predictable. In each of  the books, all one has to do to figure out who the villain is is to lay out  all the characters in the book and then choose the least likely suspect. In  Book One all signs point to Snapes being the villain, but it turns out that  it is the insignificant Dark Arts teacher. Book Two points to Draco Malfoy,  but in the end it turns out to be some insignificant character in a diary.  Book Three perhaps is worst of all concerning this. All signs point to  Sirius Black, but it turns out to be an insignificant, decrepit, old MOUSE.  These books have been made predictable with their unpredictable, ""Oh  Henry!""-style endings.These books also overuse the ""talking  killer"" premise. The entire series could be brought to a denouement if  only the villain would shut up and finish Henry Potter off. It smacks of a  Hardy Boys mystery, with Frank and Joe keeping the bad guys talking until  help can arrive.These books aren't entirely original either. If any  have read the excellent ""Earthsea"" stories by Ursula K. LeGuin  they will immediately recognize the similarities between the wizard school  at Roke and Hogwarts. One can also see that Gandalf of ""Rings""  fame inspired Albus Dumbledore. The series is even supposed to span seven  books, the same number of books in Lewis' ""Chronicles."" The  over-the-top feel of the series is reminiscent of the works of Roald Dahl.  I am not saying that these books are a rip-off of other works, but I feel  that I have seen some of this stuff somewhere before.Despite the few  shortcomings of these books, they don't fail simply because they aren't as  good as Lewis or Tolkien. Those are some pretty lofty standards. The  greatest tribute I can give this series is that after I read each book, I  look forward to the next. I have also noticed that as the series  progresses, the books seem to get better and better. ""Prisoner of  Azkaban"" shows the maturation of Ms. Rowling as an author (save the  typical ""Oh Henry"" ending). I have great hopes for the future  books.",FALSE,2000,352
"7108",5,730824,FALSE,"I wonder as I finished this third volume (having read the first three books in about a week), who Rowling keeps getting better and better.  I'm amazed, but Prisoner was the best of the first three (I've yet to Year 4...something tells me that will top the first three).  Our characters grow and deepen--indeed, Harry and Ron show that they are indeed 13 in this book.  What amazed me were the constant twists and turns.  Just as I thought I figured out what was going on, I learned I was wrong.  I adored RJ Lupin--what a wonderful new character.  I don't want to say too much about the plot--a reader deserves to discover the joy of these books for themselves.  I'll say that Malfoy and Snape still drive me nuts.

In book 5 Harry suffers a the great pain of losing someone special to him. all through the book challenges are put up to him. Also in this book harry starts going out whith Cho Chang, a very pretty 6th year girl. The suspense in the book is sogreat; the plot is so perfect it's almost like she has written the book before.

Harry still has his eye on the little Ravenclaw girl (Cho), the Weasley twins (Fred and George) are still up to no good, Ron seems to be overly concerned about who Hermione sends owls to, and even Ron's little sister's (Ginny) found a boyfriend.

The Order of the Phoenix has me shaking my head in disbelief that she is truly amazing.  Such an imagination is unbelievable as well as downright scary!  Once I got going, I could not put the book away until I finished.  A bit on the darker side than any of the previous books, I found myself thinking along the same lines as Harry the whole book...the way he felt about everything going on around him.  It's amazing how Rowling gets you to actually see the story in your head like it's as real as the keyboard I'm typing on.

"7116",5,731189,FALSE,"The book is awesome! I could not put it down long enough to sleep decently. Rowling has gone from a great writer of children's books to a master storyteller. Her descriptions, her imagination, pulls the reader in and there is hardly enough time to breath. Harry's personality has shifted dramatically in this book, he is no longer a little boy, but is on the precipice of manhood. Rowling's description of a teenager's  angst and the constant emotional rollercoaster are right on. She does not hold back in this one, and therefore, as a mother of a 9 and 6 year old, I would strongly recommend parents reading it first.

Not much new here except insight into the process of wizard housekeeping.  Umbridge as the new evil at Hogwarts lacks the menace found in the earlier books and the the prophecy revealed atthe end is no surprise as most readers will have figured that out early in book one.

The main reason why this is my favorite book has to be because of Lupin.  He's just the greatest teacher ever!  I don't exactly know what is so appealing about Lupin, but everyone loves him.  Maybe it's because he's the only teacher Harry likes (except Dumbledore, and perhaps McGonagall) and Lupin is the first decent Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've seen yet.Prisoner of Azkaban is distinctly different from the other HP books.

That's not reality, and J.K Rowling made her characters realistic...thats why Harry is darker and the book had sad, scarey moments.  In my opinion This was one of the best books because you can relate with what the characters are feeling, and you can really see how they've grown, but still in need of giudence.

It is my favorite book, and it always will be until book 6 comes out :) J.K. Rowling is an excellent writer. I would recommend this book to anyone. Her whole series is a big mystery, and almost every sentence has a clue as to what will happen in furure books, as I just found out because I got the Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter, by by Galadriel Waters and Astre Mithrandir.

For example, everyone ""turns on his/her heel"" and Harry sees Cho and and his stomach ""feels like he skipped a step going down stairs"" more than once.I also was irritated that Rowling kept building up aspects of the plot and ""dangling"" them in front of you, but not giving it to you until the end.  Then when we finally get it, it is fairly anti-climatic.  This book doesn't really teach you anything new about the characters, it is mostly just there.

However, as that part of the book is nothing compared to the rest of it. Harry goes to school, forced to hear the ridicule of some of his schoolmates, developes a romance, and runs into a whole lot of trouble. This book is exciting from beginning to end.

It was powerful, sad, comedic, something I could relate to, and a growth in matutity levels for all of the young characters.  Characters that have been seen in the last four books are now heard.  But the part of this book that has the most emotionally charged scene was when we had to let go of someone we were so fond of.  We lost our nearest and dearest.  HArry is now pubescent and angry.

"7155",3,729775,FALSE,"The Harry Potter books by J. K. RowlingThe Harry Potter books have stirred up a good deal of controversy -- perhaps without a very much solid justification.  Though engaging, there is little to them that would explain  their run-away popularity beyond the no doubt much envied chance that gave  them world-wide publicity.Rowling weaves the concept of a world of  wizards and witches (co-existing with and within the real world of London  and vicinity) into the saga of a boy in an English public school (private  boarding school).  This school for wizards is peopled with an exaggerated  mix of two-dimensional entities typical to the public school genre (but  that some are alive, some dead, some human, some not) who span the spectrum  from a sagacious beneficent headmaster to irredeemable snide, sniggering,  and scheming students and faculty and an occasionally encountered  personification of pure evil. Unlike the works in this genre of Kipling,  Wodehouse, etc., which reveal both positive and negative, the cruelty and  nobility encountered in that environment, Rowling dwells on the negative  balanced only by insipidity and occasional mindless, unexplained  heroism.The evil, violence, horror, and killing in the works are fully  three dimensional however, and this has inspired criticism and even  censorship.  I have read the existing works to my daughters without qualms  about content, but only because analysis may render stories of even the  worst of role models into valuable lessons and insights.  The world of  Harry Potter does demand some analysis when introduced to children and the  results are quite revealing.The wizard world of Harry Potter, far  from being a magical utopia, is full of the worst concepts from human  history.  Child abuse and endangerment (Potter himself) and slavery (Dobby)  are aspects of this society that seem entirely acceptable and fully  supported by its denizens.  Individuals mistakenly accused (Hagrid) of rule  violations by the (often clearly corrupt) wizard bureaucracy are sent to a  dreadful prison where they are subjected to extreme mental torment  resulting inevitably in despair and madness.  Potter himself has his  parents killed and is himself attacked when still a baby and is then raised  under circumstances worse than Cinderella or David Copperfield.The  behavior of Potter and his colleagues within the school is characterized by  unapologetic dishonesty, disobedience, and a full measure of stupidity.  After telling a lie to cover an infraction, they congratulate each other on  how inspired the lie was.  Although ostensibly run by an admirable  headmaster (principal), the school's hierarchy is clearly corrupt and all  rules are to be broken if feasible.  Even in the face of extreme peril,  when an opportunity arises, Potter will predictably opt to break every rule  just to visit a sweet shop (candy store).  The reader learns to expect  idiocy from our protagonist.  When hearing ""and he put down his  wand"" or ""they left the invisibility cloak in the shed,""  children groan with justifiable anticipation that this move will be  regretted soon -- and it is, but some deus ex machina will also predictably  come from nowhere to save the day.Integrity is also not a trait of our  hero.  When Potter is left alone in a room for a few moments and notices an  article of personal mail lying on the table, the reader already knows from  experience that Harry will not only pick up and read another's personal  mail but that he will be discovered doing so.  One would hope that the  protagonist of the series would not so blithely violate the sanctity of  personal correspondence or, having done so, would at least have the sense  and foresight to avoid detection.Nonetheless, the stories are  riveting and the final mysteries clever and unexpected.  The villains and  their evil are not Disneyfied and some nightmares will clearly result.  The  wizard world, like so many fantasy worlds, is not one the reader would  really like to experience when all is taken into account, but it makes for  a story that children can easily follow and become engrossed in -- even if  none of the characters deserves emulation.There is no place for  censorship in education. But some works deserve to be accompanied by some  circumspect scrutiny when presented to children.  One cannot protect  children effectively, and certainly not indefinitely, from inappropriate  influences but a child who learns critical thinking at an early age is much  better prepared to handle the material he or she will inevitably encounter.  Please give your children some perspective along with Harry Potter.I  should ask myself, who am I to criticize?  I have not written a run-away  best seller.  Instead I should acknowledge the debt I owe to Rowling whose  works stand as a shining example, a beacon of hope to all mediocre would-be  writers of children's literature.",FALSE,1999,54

I mean seriously, Draco Malfoy, the 'bad kid', shines bright as an angel compared to Harry.  Sure Malfoy may verbally assaults his enemies, but that's as far as he ever takes it!  Sorry I can't say the same for our young protagonist.Something else I found lacking in this book was a plot motivation.  There were only obscure plot references made through out this book, and it never really started picking up until the final chapters.  Once they had revealed the mystery they were trying to solve in the beginning, it took another 500 pages before the story follows up on that lead.  Compared to the other books, the final confrontation was spelled out in the title of the book!The book was not a total disaster however.  Those 500 pages were highly entertaining and explored many aspects of teenage life.  I must admit, this book genuinely got a rise out of me.  I would at times stop reading and bash random things to ease my frustrations directed towards certain events.So even with all this hype, I will say that that all you hardcore HP fans are probably still HP fans,  I know I am.  No matter how lowsy the book was, I think I would have enjoyed it at some level anyhow, just to check if my predictions were correct.

True, he is 15 years old in this book.  But none of his other collegues had the explosive temper that he had.

Kids wearing big black glasses and putting on fake scars, people camping out to be the first to have the next book...what's the deal with the Harry Potter mania???Now that I've had my little outburst, I'll get back to the Order Of the Pheonix. The book starts, like all the others, with Harry back at Privet Drive. He searches news and papers, thinking he'll see some sign of Voldemort's return. But there's nothing. And, he has another thought: When's he going to get out of Privet Drive??? After an attack from a couple of dementors and a not-so-enlightning conversation (or shouting match) with the Dursleys, Harry's finally out of Privet Drive, escorted by Lupin and (the real) Mad-Eye Moody. After spening the rest of the summer at the Headquaters of the Order of the Pheonix (that's where the title comes in), Harry's back at school, where a little illigal Defense Against the Dark Arts group, a new, toadlike Ministry teacher, some odd dreams about a dark corridor, and a new Quidditch member could make fifth year at good old Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, (did I spell that right?), the most interesting yet.I do have a small complaint about the change in Harry's character.

Anyone who has read the last four would agree with me. I have read the 5th book three times since it came out and it is the best of the 5. Harry is older now, coming across real-life situations and some not so common or safe. The characters have such well made personalities that it has you wishing you could be there with them, because they might as well be real. New characters arrive, like the falsely sweet Professor Umbridge, the real Mad-eye Moody, etc. Old characters remain, and one surprise comes at the end of the book; a main character dies! Voldemort is gaining more and more power, but the ministry of magic is refusing to believe it.

One thing I think JKR could have done much better on would be developing the relationship between Sirius and Remus.  These two have been friends since they were eleven, and she didn't show their connection well enough.  Remus barely makes an appearance in the book at all, and both his and Sirius's personalities are underdeveloped.  I think JKR did a wonderful job showing Harry's reaction to Sirius's death.

One thing, or person, that did impress me was Hermione. She seems to always want the best for her friends no matter what consequenes come HER way. That's really admirable. She even had to put up with that little she-witch Cho Chang, who I really despise. I really hate that character, with all of her suspicion on ""authority"" over Harry. For that, I'm very glad Harry got rid of her. I thought Harry's friends played a great role in this movie, and they're are even new characters like Luna Lovegood, and Mundungus Fletcher. But the character that truly made me want to burn her alive and feed her ashes to a snake was Professer Dolores Umbridge. I don't even see the  need to bring such a hateful little creep into the books. Also, the whole part about the Ministry of Magic and the Room of Mysteries thing really confused me. I tried to make a visual, but, it was just to hard. But a good thing about my visuals, is that I can see what the characters could actually look like because of the movies.

It is his worse year at Hogwarts yet.Also, charictors from previous books are brought back, such as Professor Lupin, Professor Moody, Professor Lockhart, and Sirius Black.

"7543",5,731516,FALSE,"""Sirius Black escaped to come after you?"" Imagine a top-security prisoner escaping prison to come after you. In the fantasy book Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J. K. Rowling, a top-security prisoner escapes from the most protected magical prison, Azkaban, to come after the one and only, Harry Potter-or at least that's what everyone thinks. Everyone thinks that Sirius Black got into prison because twelve years ago, he betrayed Harry's parents, Lily and James Potter, after Sirius became their ""Secret-Keeper."" He ""betrayed"" them by telling the Dark Lord, Voldemort, where they were so Voldemort could kill the Potters. But Voldemort had only killed Harry's parents-and that's why Harry is famous-for being such a young baby and not dying when Voldemort tried to kill him. Later, Sirius hurt twelve people using magic, and that's why he is in prison. But it turns out that Sirius was only after Peter Pettigrew, the real person who betrayed Lily and James and killed twelve people out on the street. And that's who Sirius has been going after-not Harry, but Peter. This is the best book I have ever read. I kept wanting to keep reading it on and on and not put it down. It's very interesting and surprising. It was a page-turner. This book had many surprises in it. When I found out who Sirius was really going after and why, I was shocked. He was going after Peter Pettigrew, who ""killed"" himself after Sirius ""blew up"" the people on the street. Peter was one of the people who died. But he's an Animagi, wich is wizards or witches who can turn into animals. So Peter turned into his Animagi character, a rat, and cut off his index finger wich was all people could find left of him. Later, he became a pet in Ron's(Harry's best friend) family-only so he could get the news of Voldemort, if he had enough power to rise again so Peter could kill Harry for him and be back in Voldemort's crew. It was really Peter who blew up the people on the street and transformed into a rat so he wouldn't have to go to prison, wich Sirius had been blamed for. Every chapter left a shocking ending. More than half way through the book, Ron awoke with a startle. Only because, Sirius, had been above him, with a knife, and the drapes of his four-poster cut up. The real reason was because he was looking for Ron's rat, Scabbers, wich is really Peter, trying to kill him. But no one else had known why Sirius had done that. I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy books and thrilling, page-turning chapters.

Hermione and Harry convince Umbridge to follow them into the forest, where they claim to be hiding a weapon for Dumbledore. Once in the forest, Centaurs carry Umbridge away. Harry and his friends climb aboard flying horses called thestrals and speed off to the Ministry. Once they arrive, Harry cannot find Sirius and realizes that Hermione was right. Harry also sees that one of the glass spheres has his name on it, as well as Voldemort's. Harry grabs the sphere, and Death Eaters surround to attack, demanding that Harry hand over the prophecy. Employing all of their Defense skills, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville have moderate success fighting the Death Eaters, but they are ultimately helped enormously by the arrival of several members of the Order. In the midst of the fight, Harry drops the glass sphere, and it shatters. Meanwhile, Sirius' own cousin, Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, kills Sirius. Harry is devastated.Dumbledore appears and corrals the Death Eaters. Voldemort and Lestrange escape, just as Fudge shows up. Dumbledore sends Harry back to school, where he explains how the sphere was a prophecy, which stated that Harry has a power that Voldemort does not know about. Dumbledore explains that this power is love. The prophecy goes on to claim that Harry will either destroy Voldemort or be destroyed by him. Dumbledore takes this opportunity to tell Harry why he must spend his summers with the Durselys in Little Whinging. Because Harry's mother died to save him, he is blessed with her love, a blessing that can be sealed only by blood.

"7558",5,731183,FALSE,"When I brought home a copy of Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix on June twenty-first, I had no idea what the next three days had in store for me. The reason I love Rowling's books is because, when you are reading them, you are part of the character's adventures, You share their triumph and feel their pain.At the start of the novel Harry is awaiting his fifth year at hogwarts. There is definitely a change of attitude from the previous installment of the series. Harry is now fifteen, so naturally he has become more rebellious and angry. I believe that this novel was not only to develop the future war between good and evil, but to show the development of harry as a person.During the summer leading up to his fifth year he grows angrier every day due to the fact that he has not heard from his friends, and not to mention he has no information about anything impotant happening in the wizarding world. Later in the novel Harry finds out  that nobody believes what happened between him and Lord Voldemort. People actually believe he is starved for attention, and that Dumbledore is lying about Voldemort's return.Harry arrives to Hogwarts thinking life will become easier, but later finds out otherwise. Harry realizes that Dumbledore is hiding something from him and wants to know what that something is. As you may or may not know, every year the students of Hogwarts get a new defense against the dark arts teacher, this year is no exception. Delores Umbridge(under assistant to the minister of magic)is appointed by the ministry to do the job. In no time at all she has taken over the school, removing everything that harry loved about hogwarts, she has even been given the power to ""sack"" teachers.This was also a very mysterious novel. Almost every night Harry has a dream about a big door at the end of a long corridor, and every night he goes deeper into the corridor. Harry's scar burns more often and vividly than before, harry then finds out that he is going into Voldemort's mind and feeling his thoughts. Harry finds out that Voldemort is after a secret weapon, something he didn't have before, could all of this tie in together?It is twists like this that make Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix such a great book, that's why I give it five stars and my highest recomendation.",FALSE,2003,1462

"7585",3,731188,FALSE,""" 'I knew it!' yelled Ron, punching the air. 'You always get away with stuff!' ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix returns us to the magical world of Hogwarts for a fifth installment of sorcery and boarding school andventure.The first impression of the novel is its early pace, but soon after the initial surge it is handicapped by a slightly turgid return to slow normality.Nevertheless, it is a significant improvement over the 4th installment (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), but its delivery fails to live up to its early promise, and one can't help feeling that a more ruthless editor might have pruned away some of the fat. The imagination of the author is far from lacking, but the little nuggets and gems of ideas that spiced up the earlier novels now seem spaced at wider intervals, whilst opportunities for character growth are squandered.The hellish tweeness exhibited often by the earlier novels has taken a backseat, as a more adult and sinister plot involving explorations of propaganda, bureaucratic interference and cynical scapegoating unfolds. However, the central revelation previewed on the dust-jacket has a curiously pedestrian feel about it. 'Is that it?' is the thought that runs through your mind once you have ploughed through Dumbledore's protracted exposition near the end of the novel's gargantuan 766 pages. Indeed, repetitive exposition and gossipy discussions that do little to advance the plot occupy far too many pages.There is still too much waffle about Quidditch, although Rowling appears to have abandoned the incredibly tedious blow-by-blow accounts of every single training session and match. Even more of a relief - the ugly patronisation of the ordinary 'Muggle' world is played down here. The division between a self-congratulatory elite and the ignorant wider population is still accepted without question, but not overplayed.Harry is the only character to show significant development, and this is manifested in four ways. Firstly, throughout the entire novel Harry seems angry: angry at his enemies, his friends, his guardians. This is, I think, Rowling's take on teenage moodiness, and as such a necessary addition to Potter's emotional repertoire. However, by around page 500 it begins to feel more than a little stale. Secondly, depth of character comes in the form of questioning the hithertofore angelic image of his deceased parents. This is a welcome development, and Rowling handles it well, although it appears rather late on in the novel, and not pursued as far as I'd hoped. Thirdly, when he takes on the role of teacher, Harry Potter attains a greater level of maturity than he is allowed throughout the rest of the book. Finally, and most satisfying for me, Harry appears to have largely shaken off his reliance on others for clues at vital points, and he has no more need for gifts that emphasize his specialness. He earns his rewards (and punishments) in this book - the silver spoon is no longer in view. In my view, Harry has become a much more compelling and 3 dimensional character. Only his romantic entanglements seem to be stuck at the 12 year old's level - in fact all the inhabitants of Hogwarts demonstrate this oddity.Unfortunately, none of the other characters goes through anywhere near the same amount of growth as Harry.Ron's new responsibilities seem to have zero effect on his behaviour, either to stimulate or inhibit him in any way. He is strangely sidelined in this installment of the saga. Hermione remains the dedicated swot, who, as usual, rebels when authority goes to far. As ever, she is most entertaining when bickering with Ron, although even these exchanges seem rather colourless in comparion to earlier ones. Dumbledore, thankfully absent for most of the novel, is still a cloyingly reassuring figure who is able, deus ex machina -like, to save the day. Grandfatherly in the extreme, the heroes' unalterable trust in him deprives his appearences of significant drama. As with all the previous novels bar the first, Voldemort is such a caricature that he never feels remotely threatening. True villainy of a more subtle kind is most chillingly demonstrated by a new character to the series. Draco Malfoy retains his one-note unpleasantness - it would have been refreshing to see some kind of change here. Most of Rowling's characters are either irredeemably good, or else utterly malevolent. Only Snape escapes this trap, but his character reveals little new here.The first half of the book is entertaining, but patchy. Nonetheless, I found it to be enjoyable, which made the second half all the more of a disappointment. The secondary villain was satisfyingly dealt with, but the climactic end sequence seemed muddled and flavorless.J K Rowling will undoubtedly satisfy fans, and is to be commended for her vision and imagination. I would have preferred a darker vision, but I'm sure that others' tastes will find this tale to be more than merely palatable.Ultimately, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix revisits almost all of the flaws of the preceding books, and improves on other areas only a little. This book will satisfy those who crave more information about the Wizarding World that Harry Potter inhabits, but will do little to entice the uninitiated.",FALSE,2003,1467

It sounds like it would be quite a heavy book, but it's not much different that Goblet of Fire in weight. The structure is much like all the other books, and though a lot is explained in this book, don't worry this book has an open ended finish that promises more Harry fun in the next book.The absolute best thing about this book is that the writing is 100% better and more polished that it's predicessor, the Goblet of Fire. Stylistically, this is best written Potter book to date. I think Rowling learned her lesson with the, at times sloppily written Goblet of Fire, and waited to release this one until it was perfect.

So little character development was done that at the end of it you still didn't know what makes Potter tick.  E.g. what are the feelings that make up his different responses to authority?Rowler has a very limited set of literary devices upon which she can draw.  So many times I read passages such as ""Harry Potter saw the most amazing thing in his life"", "".. felt the weirded sensation in his life"", ""... tasted the strangest taste in his life"".  Talented authors are able to clearly describe exactly what the character is experiencing without making the reader guess.The worst part of the book is that when you get near the end you realize that Rowlings is so uncreative that she is unable to solve the problems in the plot that she made without resorting to the one ""Fix-Anything-Solution"".  This solution introduces so many other near insurmountable problems into the plot that they can only be glossed over.  (I don't want to spoil the ending for those who may watch the movie by saying anything further on this.)There are big problems with morality of the entire society and characters.  No one hints of questioning the morality of sending potentially innocent people to be tortured indefinitely, as was done to Hagrid.  Authority is so prevelent and all-knowing that one wonders if anyone has anything to do other then spying on what everyone else is doing.After reading this book I really don't know what the fuss was all about.

We the reader just like Harry are confused with the world that surrounds him and I think that is what draws us in, holds us tight and won't let us go.

First of all, Sirius's death was pretty lame.  He fell through portal type thing because he taunted his cousin, and then he's gone.  During the whole book, Sirius acted quite stupid anyways, because he wanted Harry with him all the time which seemed very spoiled and selfish, and is totally contrary to the man we met in The Prisioner of Azkaban.  It was actually a relief for him to die, because he whined and complained just about as much as Harry.  That was another thing which bothered me.  I mean, it's ok for a teen to get stressed out but it's not realistic at all to yell at your friends everytime they try to talk to you.  And I thought that the room at the end of the corridor with the prophecy was stupid too.  We figured from the beginning that Harry was eventually going to have to fight Voldemort one last time and someone would die; we didn't need almost 100 pages to explain it to us again.  Umbridge also bothered me, because it just doesn't seem like a teacher would go around cutting peoples hands open and not get in trouble at all.  The basic plot is ok, but it would be better if the characters were more realistic and if the plot was less predictable.

Part of the reason for this new darkness is Harry and his friends realistically growing into teenagers. This brings with it all their troubles of being teens, like being moody, angry, frustrated, and self-centered. The second reason for this new darkness is Voldemort's return, and new troubles at school, which make Harry angry and frustrated the majority of the book.This new installment is a lot like the four other books, except that Harry now has to deal with the return of Voldemort, growing up, and the new anger that he feels all the time as a result of Voldemort. It seems like the books will get darker and darker as they go along. As in the other books, the reader learns a few new answers to the questions that were raised in the first book. Also, some new characters are added, and there are a lot more sad and exciting moments that come with the return of Voldemort. A lot of new pressures are put on Harry, and it is interesting to see how he deals with them.Although the book is very long, (800+ pages) it goes by quickly.

He feels remorse after the fact - but not because he's lied, but because he's used his dad's invisibility cloak to help him carry out his deception.

It is really long, and it took me about 3 hours and 35 minutes to finish the book.  But my favorite is still Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.It was a lot darker than the other four.  Everyone is complaining about it being darker, but JK Rowling has been hinting that it will be darker. What do you think Voldie is going to do after book four?  Give Harry a kiss and apologize, and than go away and never bother Harry again? Come on people, FACE IT!! Voldemort is back, and he's not going to turn into a angel. I think that this is probably suited for readers older than 8 because it is so dark.And the Harry that we see now is more argumentative.Personally I think that he jumped quite a bit, from being just about regular, not fighting as much, in the fourth book where he is fourteen, to fighting a lot, and getting quite a temper, at age fifteen in book five.  That was a bit quick.  But Harry still has his good traits, bravery, friendship, and at times he, err, just had to find them again.That part with Snape's Pensieve left me feeling disappointed.  I hadn't expected James to be a stuck up, arrogant brat.  And Harry hasn't apoligized to Snape, and Harry should understand now, why Snape dislikes him.And that Prophecy was old news.  And it felt like it was incomplete too.Umbridge, well was just sick.  She was not too evil, more, not right in the head.

The death of a main character (and not the one tht I was expecting) comes as a bit of a shock but you'll get over it eventually; at least faster than Harry does.

I know that the books are getting darker and darker, but this was too much.  Harry seemed to be someone I did not recognize, and I didn't feel this book was a good transition from the previous novel (four).  There were too many loose ends which I fear will not be tied up until book seven.

The 870 pages of the fifth edition are only an advantage to the reader.  This way, it takes longer to read and you do not have to worry about reaching the end as soon.  When I bought the book the day it came out, I dismally started reading the book not expecting it to be as good as the fourth (""The Goblet of Fire"" was my favorite), but I was surely mistaken.  Just taking in the first paragraph, I knew that someone would have to cut my hands off to get that book away from me before I finished it.  I spent every waking moment with my eyes glued to the pages, consuming every word printed on that page.

I thought Harry should of thanked Hermoine and Ron for their support instead of snapping at them all the time.

The  favorite topic for me and my friends is Harry Potter. Will there be a 4th  book? When will it come out? What do you think about Sirius Black? If you  were Harry what would you do?

"7814",1,731193,FALSE,"OK, I will admit I am older than the average Harry Potter reader and so my opinions on the book may be a little harsh.  But having read all four previous books, I could not help feeling disappointed at the quality of the 5th.  Yes, it was longer, Yes, the evil characters (esp. Umbridge) were even more respulsive, but like some of the other readers, I found the supposedly dramatic fight/death scenes to be lacklustered.  What made me most upset, however, was that I felt Rowling did not do justice to Harry in the book. (I still love the way she presents Hermione and Ron though!) But as for Harry...having him shout and lose his temper mindlessly all the time is not the way to depict an adolescent ""coming of age.""  It just made me annoyed at Harry, not sympathetic.Finally, there are some little things that just really bother me.  For instance,  WHY, didn't Harry use the mirror (as opposed to the fireplace) when he wanted to make sure Sirius was OK?!  It seems to me--no, I should say the BOOK explicitly _mentions_ that the mirror would have been a hell of a lot more effective at getting to see Sirius than going through the fireplace and asking Kreacher.  You'd think the emergency situation Harry was in would make him remember.  Instead, he only remembers at the end of the book for other reasons.  It's just like in the movies when the main character goes upstairs to investigate something creepy but for some inexplicable reason, always FAILS to turn on the lights!!!...only in movies I can understand b/c the dark creates an atmosphere.  But in this case, if only the author had given the book a second glance she would have seen the incongruity and taken the mirror out!  (i.e. there was no purpose for Rawling to bring the mirror into the book since Harry never used it...thus it only made it implausible that Harry would use the fireplace to reach Sirius and thus swallow the lies of Kreacher).  But I am rambling now.  Anyways, not that a negative review is going to make people NOT read the book--and it's not my intention to stop ppl from reading HP.  I just see no reason to keep saying it's her BEST when it clearly is NOT, and hopefully as the series goes on, she really WILL become a better writer and present Harry a little more plausibly as a maturing teen and not some bumbling fool always shouting his head off and doing stupid things.

The book delivers non-stop action, but this time without the comedy and cheerful flippancy that the precursors to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had. Instead the story has realistic undertones that set the mood of the book very well: the readers should not fool themselves into thinking that Phoenix will be another light-hearted tale of Harry Potter and his friends and their adventures in the magical world.

The characters in book five, The Order of the Phoenix, often seemed disjointed, and at times I was not sure which character to root for.

In the previous 4 Harry Potter books, I was unable to put the books down because they were so good, however this time, I was unable to put the book down because I wanted to keep reading to see if it got any better.  Needless to say I was very disappointed in Harry's latest ""adventure"", or perhaps I should say Harry's latest ""whine and moan""  The whole tone of the book is different from the others, as it is an incredibly angry book, with the majority of it consisting of arguments between characters that we have grown to love over the previous books.  And the majority of Harry's role in the book is to act in a selfish ""why me"" attitude, at the fact that in order to protect him, people must keep information from him.  I was shocked how little story could be contained within such a massive book.  The book could have easily been half as long, as all the important parts occur within the last 200 pages.  The book is not BAD, but I feel that it fails to live up to the quality of story that J.K Rowling has provided us with in the previous 4 novels.

I really hope the upcoming books are going to fix that problem which the book 5 caused. The book is interesting, but I was very dissapointed when I realized that Quiditch isn't much of a deal in this book. I was very furious. My favs stayed the same: HP4,HP1,HP2,HP3.

Though it was not such a bad book I can't say that I am glad that I bought it. I know that Harry is now a teenager and his glands are now developed, but for the usually passive Potter to go ballistic in the story's timeframe of give and take two months is completely out of character. Also Harry's heated outbreaks of self-absorbed screams are hardly believable. Harry's attempts to gain attention when fending off Dementors is quite annoying as it is inconsistent with his behavior in the Third book where Harry's behavior was, as most of you might remember, more of concerned for his own welfare and safety. Shouldn't Harry Potter be even more worried about his and his friend's lives, now that You-Know-Who has been resurrected? Anyway, fans will not fail to notice that the plot twists that made the series legendary are missing. The few questions that were answered at the end of the book like: ""Why is Lord Voldemort after Harry?""  have not really been given light. I mean it is already obvious from the start of the story that Harry and Voldemort will eventually have to duel each other to a supposed death but to not give a ""why"" is just annoying. Anyway the book is all right in relative terms but for those who have been itching to find out what's going to happen next with our young wizards should be forewarned. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" might not stimulate you as much as the previous books in the series. For those who are die hard fans of Harry Potter well there is enough here to keep you reading, though I'm wondering if it is enough to keep you guys entertained. My suggestion is to borrow the book from a friend and make sure you really, really, REALLY want it. Seriously, I was a Harry Potter fanatic before this book. I waited patiently for it.

Order of the Phoenix is like the Matrix Reloaded of the Harry Potter series: It focuses so much on the Harry Potter mythology that it loses sight of the magic of Harry Potter.The first 150 pages are quite boring. I've always thought that the strength of the series lied in Hogwart's, and like Goblet of Fire, this book takes a long time getting there. I felt like I had to muddle my way through the exposition, reading the same things over and over. Yes, Harry can't know what's going on yet. Rowling gives a little at a time, but she took too long this time.This book felt like its sole purpose was to move the story along, to give fans something to read and keep Harry Potter fresh in their minds.

There are some suprising twists in the book that I hadn't expecting. There was one thing wrong though- I think J.K. Rowling's writing might have been influenced by the movies.

I read other reviews that said the author has no idea what a teenage boys life is like, this is far from it, and it sure sounds perfect to me... the person who said that was a woman too, what does she know!?Anyway, like I said, it started fine, introducing the characters again, for those of you like me who forgot everything about the first books mainly. But if there was one problem about this story it was this:  HARRY DIDNT DO ANYTHING... Its true. Everything he tried failed. Every ambition he had for this year in the book was eventaully lost. We cant hear about his quidditch matches, he lost Cho because he is apparently stupid when it comes to girls, and his end meeting with Voldemort, was a mistake by him, if he didn't even go, nothing bad would have happened in the first place. Then, at the end, after we listen to a... long talk with harry by dumbledore, we find Harry has no ambitions except destroy Voldemort, his destiny.

"8386",3,731184,FALSE,"I have been an avid Harry Potter fan since the publication of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and I will, of course, continue reading the series.  However, I can't help but wonder if J.K. Rowling's creative juices may be running dry, and that that may account for the long delay in publishing this book.  I hope that her public will let her take five years, or ten, to write the next one if that will allow her to create something more convincing and well constructed than this mess of a novel.The problem that began to become apparent in Book IV becomes overwhelming here.  That is the fact that, with the resurgent Lord Voldemort becoming a major driving force in the plot, it just isn't very convincing to locate the story with Harry at Hogwarts.  To some degree the problem is unavoidable, but it could have been handled much more gracefully.  The narrative is disjointed and sloppy, and not nearly enough happens to justify the book's immense length.  The climactic battle is just laughably bad.All of that would be ok, given that much of these books' appeal lies in the characters.  However, there is a second major problem, one which Rowling could easily have avoided.  That is the fact that Harry spends the entire book in a profound case of the sulks.  It's as if the author read in an adolescent psychology book that 15-year-olds are moody and self centered, and got completely carried away with the idea.  Yes, Harry has reason to be frightened, frustrated and unhappy.  But he's also a kid with his friends at school, and there must be some moments of fun in his life.  An 870-page adolescent snit is a tedious ordeal for a reader to undergo.  All the pranks and jokes that made the other books such fun are missing here.And as for Harry's frustration at being left out of things, there is one thing he is asked to do in the fight against Lord Voldemort.  It's very important.  Harry can't be bothered to do it.  He doesn't learn, he doesn't apologize, he doesn't grow.  He just sulks even more at the end of the book than at the beginning.Hopefully things will get more interesting in Book VI.",FALSE,2003,1463

It introduces several new characters including Professor Trelawney, Wormtail, Professor Lupin, and my personal favourite: Sirius Black. He's the classic tall, dark, and gloomy silent guy who knows more than he let's slip. Although some of the things he let's slip for Hermione were a little shocking, but I know Rowling did that just to really *snicker*flesh*snicker* out his character.  The book is full of mystery like the second book, when Sirius Black, who supposedly was responsible for the death of Harry's parents, escapes from the wizard prison, Azkaban, and thought to be after Harry to finish what Voldemort couldn't. Speaking of which, this is the first book that Voldemort doesn't make an appearance in.  Lupin is probably the best addition to this book. He is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and befriends Harry quickly. Lupin is a very competent teacher, unlike that idiot from the second book and sirius black dies in the fifth book teaches Harry some very useful spells to defend himself from the forces of evil. The only complaint I have about him is that he seems a little too friendly towards Harry, if you know what I mean.  Trelawney was actually sort of an annoying character, whom I wouldn't have missed if Rowling had left her out. She is rather annoying, although I know she is supposed to be. Trelawney just does that job too well. Trelawney's advances on Ron were a little inappropriate, though, and I had to explain a few things about the birds and the bees to my children because of this book. But don't let that scare you!

Is whimsical, compelling plot of Harry's journey through Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and its climactic ending left me biting my nails in anticipation of Book Five.Then along came Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.What happened?This gigantic book (nearly 900 pages long) starts off much as the others do, with Harry stuck with his odious relatives, the Dursleys, including a long scene which Harry spends outright taunting his despicable cousin.Yes, this is Harry we're talking about.The explanation of raging hormones and teenage angst can only go so far. We spent four books with a likeable, brave kid who, after he discovered his magical aptitude, refused to be pushed around. This is a big jump to the guy who spends the entire first third of the book either sulking, wallowing in self-pity, or exploding at his friends Ron and Hermione every time they open their mouths. He's harder to like, and his ""anguish"" makes the plot drag for pages on end.The plot is terminally slow, with the entire two hundred pages or so before he actually boards the train spent complaining about how none of the adult wizards (members of the ""Order of the Phoenix"") will tell him what's going on. This leaves us in anticipation of Dumbledore's ""tell-all"" session at the end of the book that we are sure will leave us astonished with its blinding revelation.Trouble is, the revelation is nothing we didn't know or suspect before.The book trudges along with no real sense of purpose. (Ex. Protect the Sorcerer's Stone, find the Chamber of Secrets). The entire year at Hogwarts is spent rebelling against a truly vile new character, Hogwarts ""High Inquisitor"" Dolores Umbridge. The book muddles through several subplots that seem to be there only to serve a brief purpose at the end, such as conveniently getting Harry out of trouble.

I don't want to give away too many details that would ruin anyone's reading experience, but my biggest gripe is near the last portion of the book.  This is usually a time for discovery of the story behind and linking of all the little pieces of information.

In this book I also began to hate Harry Potter as a character most of all.  In the books before he seemed to be the under dog, who no body understood.  The reader hates snape for his mistreatment of Harry. Then Harry's personality seemed to do a 180 spin.  He now seemed more angry, selfish, egotistical, and most of all hard headed. In fact it is these four things that get him into trouble.I began to see snapes hatred of Harry as not just pure jealousy. I also found myself putting this book down and doing other things with my life. This was not the case with the other books, which i read until my eyes bled.  This book was just too depressing for me to be able to move quickly through.I hope this book sets up a great book six.  Maybe i won't have such high expectations.

Other characters, such as Ron, Hermoine, and Neville, are developing nicely and becoming more interesting.  I noticed this, but Harry never did.  The book is predictable and filled with red herrings that are more annoying than titillating.  If Rowling's intent is to make Harry more human, she may have succeeded but he is much less likeable.  And what happened to his brain?!  Have raging hormones and adolescent selfishness turned it to cottage cheese?  If he had used half the sense he was endowed with in earlier volumes, this book would have been about 250 pages -- but probably a lot more fun.

Keeping in mind the last 4 books nobody but nobody expected a disappointing 5th part. But unfortunately HP part 5 miserably fails to live upto the expectations of a reader. J.K. Rowling totally forgot that she is a child writer and she is not writing for an adult. Somewhere between pleasing everyone, children and adults she lost her balance and ended up writing a book which a child wouldn't enjoy neither would an adult because they are reading a book to enjoy themselves and not to see more brutality and get depressed.In the new characters Luna Lovegood was good, Dolores Umbridge was awful, Kreacher was boring and Bellatrix Lestrange was really sick. Harry potters behaviour was totally unexpected and irritating at times. But the people who stole the cake were the Weasley Twins. They were like the saving grace. Last but not the least the developing relationship between Ron and Hermione is totally adorable and cute.Inspite of the above points Harry Potter will be read by each and everyone because everyone is highly curious about the end.

So thats what this review's for, to help balance up more. After all, its through acknowledging weaknesses that things can improve. Firstly, as said by some, the story starts out rather draggy before rushing to a swift climax right at it end. Then comes this plot of a Magic Minister's political maneuvering. Its so awfully simplistic and crude its a sin. Perhaps its made to fit into a child's understanding...oh well. Then there's this pattern I found. In an attempt to turn the story darker, we are told, there's another person whose going to die. One in the Goblet and now one more in the Order of Phoenix. An interesting pattern: Both characters are the only ones in all the books(if my memory serve me right) decribed as ""good-looking"", ""handsome"" and ""male"". How coincidental that they are also the only ones who manage to die dramatically to many reader's dismay. Does Rowling has a problem with good looking alpha males? Oh and the characters in general are getting more bland. Not much of a development, especially for Potter, after all the experiences he went through in the first four books, one would thought it would profoundly mellow his being in a way that could be skifully narrated by the author. And we would have expect more treatment and attention on establishing Dumbledore's character... No such luck. As for the other characters--too repetitive, its getting stale and disengaging. Not that I'm going to start a dissertation on where the character development and narration have gone awry. All in all, the series's magic touch is fading in its attempt to conform and follow the fantasy genre's path of political intrigue, prophecies, heroes, good vs evil concepts and ideas. It leaves one with a sour aftertaste of having a whiff of something really wonderful only to have it dissipated before one can fully savour it.

A story should flow nicely.Harry Potter is a good series, but this one just doesn't feel right. The beginning is very slow, and detailed, when the ending is somewhat quick and dropped.

It is unneccesarily long, there is a death of a major character at the end, which is basically Harry's fault, and also the whole series of events at the end could have been avoided if Harry had used an item that was given to him at the begining of the book, but he completely forgot about. But the most major flaw of this book is Harry's attitude throughout. He's no longer the mild mannered, polite boy he was in the previous books. He's bad tempered, aloof, and at times inconsiderate and mean, especially to those who have helped him and shown him the most kindness in previous books, like Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore.In one part he sends his owl Hedwig to Ron and Hermione to deliver letters, and desperate for answers he tells Hedwig to peck at them until they write back, later on they explain that they were forbidden to write back to him, but he doesn't apologize for what he told Hedwig to do, and he's not even sorry they have been injured by his owl. Then he has to attend a hearing to decide if he will be expelled from Hogwarts, and have his wand taken away for using magic outside of school, Dumbledore defends him, but Harry's not very appreciative, and is upset with Dumbledore for ignoring him. Later he discovers that Proffesor Snape was treated very badly by his father when they were younger, and accepts the rather lame excuse offered for his father's actions. He is also told that it was Snape who sent members of the order of the phoenix to the Ministry of Magic, where he and his friends were rescued at the end of the book, but still hates Snape despite all this. Then Dumbledore literally saves his life when he's attacked by Voldermort, but Harry doesn't even thank him, instead he has a temper tantrum, and wants to attack Dumbledore during one of his many fits of anger. Harry's bad attitude throughout this book is very uncharateristic, and it makes him unlikable.There are funny parts to the book, which is why I gave it two stars, like Peeves the ghost, the Weasley twins, and the teachers and students at Hogwarts feuding with a very mean new teacher. But because Harry is basically a jerk, and the plot of this book is so different from the others in this series, it seems as though it was written by a different author.

"10244",5,730402,FALSE,"Having heard many people lament the way Harry Potter is encouraging children to explore the occult, I'd like to offer an alternate view. I'm a conservative Christian who teaches theology at a university and publishes many articles in theological journals, and I don't like witchcraft. However, given that it's difficult to keep these books away from children who visit bookstores frequently, my wife and I have read the series to our children, ages 10, 12, and 15, and discussed the ideas with them.""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is of a much higher literary caliber than the first two novels. Like them, there are lots of amusing jokes, lots of word play to delight the alert reader, but there is much more depth to the characterization in this book.I think we would do well to look at these series as we look at C.S. Lewis's ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series or Tolkien's books. The books border on allegory, but aren't. However, they are full of allusions to biblical ideas. Joanne Rowling is writing about the age old celestial battle between good and evil, God and Satan. The witch and wizard setting allows her to develop characters who learn to use magical powers analogous to the spiritual powers developed by Christians devoted to prayer and Bible study, yet without offending those who aren't interested in God. She is teaching a generation of children how to act. By casting spells? No. She continuously pokes fun at that aspect of the books. She is teaching children the value of loyalty, generosity, courage, study, honesty, turning the other cheek, loving, forgiving, sacrificing to save others. She is teaching them you don't have to be big and handsome to be a success. The major moral challenge Harry faces in this book is whether or not to kill the man who killed his parents. Most kids would say, ""Kill him!"" Harry struggles, but makes the right choice. Indeed, this book is full of Harry and other characters honestly struggling with really tough decisions but making the right decisions.In a way, the wizard side of things in Rowling's world is a bit like the angelic world, with the Hogwarts students as apprentice angels. The Bible teaches that God is at war with the forces of evil--forces consisting of fallen angels who once were good. (Have you noticed: Voldemort: Vol de Mort: Flight of Death (French): Death Angel; vol also brings to mind the Latin word for ""will,"" suggesting ""the one who wills death."") These children are ""sorted"" into the camp of deceit and darkness or into one of three camps which tend toward goodness, according to the the choices they have already made in their lives, but each students has to learn and make choices.Harry is Christ-like in a number of ways. He has been chosen, anointed. He has been tempted, offered the world, offered power, but has said no. I don't have time to look at this in depth here, given the space limitation. However, I would encourage Christian parents to read these books with their children and talk about the decisions made and the parallels to the battle between God and Satan, good and evil. This will help children determine to do what is right, place themselves on the side of goodness.

"10368",3,731185,FALSE,"For me Prisoner of Azkaban set a standard for all Harry Potter books to follow. Goblet of Fire was starting to get too tenuous and slow-paced to read. Order of the Phoenix seemed much worse. Attention to trivial details was overemphasized and many things happened that I found myself too incredulous. The characters were painted in personalities that were overstretched. Harry's character became too dark, too angry, in contrast to his previous personality. Dumbledore as he would later admit became too senile and dumb, in contrast to his enormous wisdom in the first four books. Professor Snape was much too haunted by a past experience that for me is really not a big deal. Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, and the rest of the Ministry of Magic ,except for Amelia Bones, Arthur Weasley, and two old wizards, were too unreasonable. Even Snape was not that unreasonable. Lastly, when a character (I won't tell) died, I never felt Harry Potter's sadness, just his anger at being kept in the dark and at his being stupid. Yes, I understand that he would be angry at first but up to the end, the book narrated Harry Potter's grief in a matter-of-fact way so unlike the first four books. In an afterthought, the character never had to die. There was for me no compelling reason to kill him/her. It was not like s/he was outmatched or facing Voldemort or something. The relevance of Harry Potter's prophecy is also suspect. Overall, I think J.K. Rowling overstretched her imagination this time.

Harry's adventures have already kept us entertained over the span of four books and now, in the fifth chapter, the most intricate story is given.  In ""Order"" Harry emerges as a very angry youth, he expresses rage towards the Dursleys, his friends, teachers, and the adults he holds in high regard.  An event occurring in the Muggle world causes Harry to become involved in the Wizarding government who soon decides to put their hands into Hogwarts business.  Knowing Harry, much adventure and mystery does await his next year at Hogwarts and Order of the Phoenix doesn't let you down.  You're given the romance, action, mystery, and tragedy.  But this doesn't mean the novel isn't filled with fun (the Weasley brothers Fred and George take care of that).  The most heinous of all characters (possibly even worse than Voldemort) comes from one of the new additions to the Hogwarts staff.  All of this isn't helped because Harry and his fellow fifth years also have to deal with their exhausting O.W.L.s.  But don't let the 800+ pages get you down, you will become so involved you won't notice how fast the pages turn.  All leading up to an amazing climax that will definitly leave you begging for more.

"10513",1,731196,FALSE,"Harry spends the first 234 pages sulking and feeling sorry for himself, and it doesn't get much better afterward.  Forget the sentiment that ""well, this is how normal kids would act.""  Not all kids have such a lousy attitude!  There are also some serious leaps in logic;  he's supposed to be banned from playing Quidditch for life by an evil new professor, but even after her true identity is revealed, the book never gets Harry back on the team.Lying, sulking and walking around raging against loved ones such as Dumbledore are shown without any assistance for kids to grasp that although Harry is acting this way, he's not in the right.  Later there is a tie-in with Voldemort (gee, what a surprise!), but it isn't clear until way after the fact.  Harry shocks himself with some of his behavior, but shows very little remorse or self-reflection.  The implication is that it's somehow okay, because after all, he's faced a lot of evil-doers in the past.  Note that those encounters from previous books, if we're to follow the logic in Book 5, did NOT provide Harry  with a stronger character or more likability.  Nope, his history just adds to his self-pity and despair.  He even lists them at one point. (""In first year, it was this, in second year, it was that... How much should a boy have to face?"")  Well, if a boy is the central character in a multimillion dollar industry, I'd say quite a lot, and without whining about it.  His only real reflection is on how rough he's had it.  This whole bit makes him less likable and a much less sympathetic character.There are numerous authors, such as C.S. Lewis, who skillfully show their protagonist(s) going wrong and help you see along the way whether the character knows he's on the wrong path.  (It's made clear that there is a wrong path!)  I didn't get this same impression with Harry.Finally, I'm seeing what religious groups keep yiping about;  when things are truly bleak and Harry desperately needs a divine miracle, he has nobody good to pray to.  When his heart is truly broken over the death of a loved one, again, he has nobody, no Higher Power, nothing to end his suffering.  If you want to spend 870 pages with a whiny, sulky, formerly admirable boy who winds up headed toward clinical depression, go ahead and read this book.

The story meanders pointlessly revisiting old ground (Hagrid's in trouble again. The kids end up in the Forbidden Forest again.) but failing exactly because she abandoned the previously set cliche: a strong opponent in the service of ultimate evil confronting Harry directly over a clearly outlined goal.Also--and perhaps most importantly, considering who the main audience are--""disorientate"" and ""commentate"" are unforgivable sins in popular children's literature.

"10977",1,731194,FALSE,"I am a devoted adult HP follower.  I devoured book one in an afternoon and was ready to sign up for Hogwarts.  Rowling has created a wonderful world and incredible characters with humor, depth and spirit.However....Book five was just bad.  I enjoy a good long book if it has something to say and a story to tell.  Unfortunately, Rowling could have said it in 350 pages but meanders on for 800+.  The bad editing, the bad pacing, the sad and sorry plot, which doesn't really make an appearance until 3/4 of the way through, and the betrayal of the core of her character development have made this simply a bad book.We all love Harry Potter because no matter what is thrown at him, he is honest, loyal, caring and brave... er... he was until this last book anyway.  Now he is just so whiny that you want to grab him and shake him.  He doesn't need extra Defense agains the Dark Arts classes, he needs a good old fashioned spanking or a serious dose of Prozac.The new villian, Umbridge, is not suspenseful and does not inspire the reader to want to see her get hers (which she doesn't really), the character is sickening.  Her physical and psycological torture of the students and staff is not darkly funny nor does it add to the plot.  Her character is simply turns your stomach the way a child abuser would.  I guess Rowling brought her in because Voldemort was completely lame as an enemy this time.In each book, Harry has grown and moved closer to understanding himself and that he world is made up of shades of gray.  My greatest disappointment in this book wasn't the death of the important character, but in the lack of growth in Harry.  He gets to see inside the mind of Professor Snape, he sees his father and Sirus' merciless and unprovoked attack on Snape as a fifth year because they were bored.  Yet other than a prerequisite, ""Awe shucks, we shouldn't have done that."" from Sirus; Harry doesn't deal with this, nor does it advance his relationship with Snape.Rowlings biggest disaster in book 5 is that she took a lovable and inspiring character, the underdog we all love and cheer for, and made him unlikeable and repulsive.",FALSE,2003,1473

Much of the action has a video-game quality; the luminous imaginings of the earlier books are largely gone.  The over-arching themes are not clearly postulated. What exactly is Voldemort threatening, and what is at stake in the magic (and maybe muggle) worlds if he wins? Finally, about adolescence.  Yes, it is a moody time, but what about the flashes of humor, the enthusiams, the quest for truth,and the vivid imaginative life that are also part of that age?  To me, Harry seems more like an egotistical lout than a complex teenager in this book, and I miss him.",FALSE,2003,1483

"11197",2,731528,FALSE,"For all that I was expecting of this book, it fell quite short.The plot, I think, was underdeveloped, Harry's little 'love affair' inane. J. K. Rowling put in prophecies and such to make the plot look thought out. The killing of Sirius was pointless, and she just did it for dramatic tension. If you ask me, she's probably just going to bring him back anyway.Harry appeared as a raging hormonal teen who changed quite a bit over the summer. During most of the book he is screaming, yelling and arguing with his friends. Harry is completely pointless in this, and he can't defend himself. He has to get Sirius, and Dumbledore to come to his rescue.Fudge realized that Voldemort really was back at the end of the book, which makes for a less interesting plot in the books to come.Quite a few new characters were introduced to the story, who were often underdeveloped, and didn't seem to have a reason for what they were doing.In all, I think this is a poor example of Ms. Rowling's writing skills, and she definitely could have written it better.

"11375",4,731190,FALSE,"I will admit, that unlike many people reading or finishing ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" right now, I was not salivating with anticipation to read J.K. Rowling's latest installment of her Harry Potter epic.  I mainly read the books to see what the fuss was all about, and to not let the films spoil the texts for me.That said, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is as thrilling and spectacular as any novel I have ever read.  Where Rowling truly distinguishes herself is in the characterization of her hero, Harry Potter.  In the earlier four books, Harry, while interesting and earning our affection as readers, never really seemed falliable.  He almost always got his way, always seemed to snatch the snitch at the right moment, Gryffindor tower always seemed to win--in short, he was perfect, and while the younger readers reveled in Harry's triumphs, as an older reader, I felt the character was coming a bit too one-dimensional.Wisely, Rowling gives Harry ample flaws in his fifth year at Hogwarts.  From the outset of the book, he has trouble controlling his temper--which is exacerbated by both adolescence and a covert operation set up by Dumbledore and his Order of the Phoenix where everyone from Ron and Hermione to even Aunt Petunia knows what is going on and is dead set to keep Harry in the dark.  Rowling expresses these outbursts crudely, WITH ENORMOUS TYPE SIGNIFYING HARRY'S ANGER, but the point is made.  Here, more so than ever, the intelligence and ambition of Hermione and the loyalty and good nature of Ron work to balance Harry's character as foils, and on more than one occasion they ask for Harry not to take his rage out on them.Adding to Harry's flaws is his difficulty in his relationship with Cho Chang.  Harry and Ron express difficulty in dealing with girls (Ron asks Hermione to write a book translating women's thoughts to boys) which is only a natural step for Rowling to take with her characters.  I wish though that she would drop Cho Chang as a character, because I don't find her very interesting, nor do I see why Harry is attracted to her besides her looks.  (I hope that Rowling, in the concluding installments of her series, fleshes out the romantic relationship between Hermione and Harry, which I have noticed since the first book.)I think also what makes ""Order of the Phoenix"" soar are its new villains--namely Professor Dolores Umbridge and the Ministry of magic.  Here the villain isn't a professor with Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head or a basilisk or scores of dementors, but a very human adversary and the corrupt institution she for whom she is employed.  Wisely, Rowling shifts the focus off of Voldemort onto Umbridge and the Ministry (although Voldemort's presence in the novel always there).  Here the conflict becomes not good versus evil, but rather a question of how two distinct groups wish to contain and protect innocent people from an ultimate evil.  Wonderfully, Rowling shows that both ways might not be right.  Certainly the way the Ministry's policy of denial about Voldemort and the manipulation of media (the Daily Propher) and education (Umbridge's presence at Hogwarts first as professor then as ""High Inquisitor"" then as Dumbledore's replacement!) to reflect a state of tranquility is the wrong way.  Topically, the Ministry reminds me of President Bush and his spin doctors, except that where Bush wants to whip up everyone into a state of paranoia, Cornelius fudge and his John Ashcroft--Dolores Umbridge--want everybody to stay calm.Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix are also wrong, overprotecting Harry and Sirius Black to the point of making them both insufferable and rash.  Dumbledore admits as much to Harry at his now-standard end of the book speech (but here it is wholly welcome, necessary, and relieving).Ultimately, Rowling advocates for rebellion as the best way to deal with growing forces of malevolence.  The book's juiciest conflicts appropriately come at Hogwarts, where Umbridge grows into a tyrant and everyone save Filch the groundskeeper is against her.  Umbridge won't teach the students any practical defense against the dark arts (as is her job)--outlawing it, even--so Hermione suggests that Harry surreptitiously teach a group of students a practical defense.  They dub themselves ""Dumbledore's Army,"" knowing fully of Voldemort's threat.  The professors, who all are monitored and interrupted by Umbridge (""hmm, hmm""), become increasingly sarcastic and bitter to her, knowing full well that a government should never interfere with the educations of its young citizens.  Hogwarts eventually becomes blissfully anarchic, with the Weasley twins leading the way and even the tight lipped Professor McGonagall defying the authority of Dolores Umbridge.  In one great moment McGonagall even encourages Peeves the mischievious ghost to wreak havoc by showing him the right way to unscrew a chandelier.  She also defends Hagrid, whom Umbridge fires, nearly to her death.  It is this sort of rebellious spirit that Rowling defines as heroic, and ultimately necessary to overcome an adversary.  A ministry or an Order is unable to define what a hero is, but an individual, through rebellion, can become one.The book is not perfect, and I think Rowling could benefit from some kind editorial suggestions (870 pages is simply too long). Yet the plot zooms and Rowling is surer than ever about which directions to take with her characters.  Rowling has done her job well, for I now am salivating with anticipation for parts six and seven.  With the young readers who are Rowling's key audience and biggest fans, like Harry, growing older, I hope they glean from ""Order of the Phoenix"" that while you can't just go around breaking the rules all of the time, a certain sense of rebellion is needed to truly do the right thing.",FALSE,2003,1469

"11403",1,731202,FALSE,"This is the weakest book in the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling may have lost her wand in writing it. Basically, there are no amazements, no grand scenes, no impressive characters, events, or discoveries like those found in the four previous novels. The Order of the Phoenix is introduced as an ordinary club house, whose members come and go, but we never discover what they do of importance. Nor we know where the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters are, and what they do. We are told they are after a misterious weapon stored somewhere in the Ministry of Magic, but nothing more. The old characters are pale shadows of themselves - Moody, Lupin and the other wizards appear no more than moving puppets. Most part of the book is devoted to a weary Hogwarts life, where everything is a deja-vu: lessons, Quidditch, Hogsmeade trips, night escapades under invisibility cloak. Thestars are nothing compared to the dragons, the basiliscus, the unicorn, the spiders and other powerful magical animals: they are a symbol of the gloom poorness of this book. The only new characters, Umbridge and Grawp have no resemblance at all with great figures like the former Lupin, Aragog or the unicorn; they are mere caricatures. The whole story have no centre, or a very weak one. Umbridge seizure of power is unlikely and in the end boring, like all the Ministry-Dumbledore quarrel. Hagrid's account of his trip among the giants is totally uninteresting, and the role of Grawp unecessary. The final unveiling of the weapon (which isn't a weapon at all) is higly disappointing, like the magical battle beetween the Death Eaters and the Order's 7th cavalry, arriving to rescue at the last minute. Even the spells are the same old `accio' or `stupefy'. The problem is nobody is going to be ever stupefied by a shoddy story like this - boredom is more likely the word.

"11462",4,731191,FALSE,"Oh I think I might be the first person to review this book.  Any way.  Like The Goblet of Fire and.. actually like most of the books, a great deal of the beginning of the book is during summer vacation.  Things become fishy when Harry and Dudley are attacked by dementors right there in Little Whinging.  A bunch of stuff follows, involving a hearing and Harry having to live at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a group of witchs and wizards against Voldemort.  Any more would be revealing the plot and I know that that was a horrible synopsis, but if a synopsis is what you want, then read the editorial reviews.  The book has the same quality that makes you not want to stop reading until you get to the very last page.  And when you get there, its hard to tell if you were cheated or not.  850 pages and a lot less plot twists than Goblet of Fire.  But even then, there are a lot of moments worth savoring.  For example:Ron is on the quidditch team?What's up with Harry and Cho?Who's the crazy new Defense against the Dark arts teacher?  I personally thought that the highlight of the book was The D.A., otherwise known as Dumbledore's Army.  Formed as a 'screw you movement' against the tyrannical Professor Umbridge.  My main problem with this book and the series in general is the close mindedness it displays.  The whole moral backdrop is gryffindor=too cool for school heroes.  Dumbledore was one.  Harry is one and he's cooler than you.  Slytherin= Bad, incredibly weird looking people.  Stupid, ugly followers of Voldemort.  Harry=Hero  Everyone else= bystanderOf course, it isn't all as cut and dried as that, but that's the gist of it.  I find it hard to believe that death eaters (Voldemort's followers) are never from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw.  They are from Slytherin.  Harry too, must always be the hero, a theme that is explored in the book.  Knowing that even when Harry rages and pities himself in the beginning of the book, he will bounce back with the incentive of pretty, shiny heroicness.  And that is why I gave the book four stars instead of five.  It shouldn't get five just for being Harry.",FALSE,2003,1470

I cannot articulate exactly what this novel is missing, I'll leave it to a better reviewer. All I can say is tha when a major character died I barely felt a thing. Also, unlike the other four Harry Potter books, the ending seems forced and had no important surprises. Overall, this book was less enjoyable to read than the others. Some may be wondering, ""If you didn't like it that much, then how did you finish an 800 page book in 2 days?""

Book 5 left my enthusiasm deflating like a balloon on a cactus.  After the great windup of Book 4, with danger and conflict imminent, the stage seemed set for an epic battle between good and evil.  Instead, we had this repetitious, self-important snoozefest. I suspect Rowling is too contented to write well anymore; when she was a struggling loser in Scotland, she had an incentive to create a livelier, more vivid world to escape to than the one she was stuck in, but now it's clearly a chore for her to tear herself away from her much more interesting life to try to rekindle her interest in a moody brat at a boarding school.  The wit and cleverness of her earlier books is dead, but I'm shocked by how her sense of pacing has gone to pieces in this book.  She seems to be going through the motions of setting up cliffhangers, only to run out of steam and abandon them when it's clear she has nothing interesting to say anymore.  Hagrid is mysteriously absent through almost half the book; as the previous volume ended with him about to head off on a secret mission, I had high hopes that something interesting would result when he finally returned.  But his interminable recitation chapter delivered absolutely nothing.  He went on his mission, accomplished nothing and came home, and Rowling thinks this is enough material to stretch over an entire chapter.  Another sign that her inventiveness is flagging is the way she is recycling her gimmicks from earlier books.  We read about the Put-Outer in Book 1, but she either thinks her readers are too stupid to remember, or if they liked it once they'll like the exact same thing all over again, because she plows through an almost identical description of the gadget in Book 4.  Everything that was fresh and funny the first time is trotted out again for an encore.  I'm not impressed by demands of Book 5 fans that I read the book twice, or three times or ten times until I've grown numb to its flaws and have succeeded in brainwashing myself that it's good.  I was happy to read the earlier books more than once; I can't even be bothered to dig out my copy of this one to look up a quote, and I doubt I'll ever look at it again.

"11839",1,731225,FALSE,"Several reviewers say that the Weasley twins are the only characters with a personality in HP5.  I disagree.  To me, Severus Snape is the most interesting character in this novel - perhaps the only one with the potential to become a real character, not a 2D cutout.  Rowling overlooks this, and this is her biggest failure (worse than the flat prose & exasperating overuse of ellipsis; worse than the endlessly shrill, angry tone of the book).The case?  At first glance, Snape seems like just another grown-up bully.  Piece together his past, though, and the story is much more interesting: he was cruelly, mercilessly bullied himself as a child and teenager, simply for existing; he joined up with Voldemort, but reformed (how and why? - that would be an interesting story) and is now one of Dumbledore's trusted agents; though he loathes Harry Potter because of his (arrogant, cruel) father's bullying, he still saves Harry's life on more than one occasion, because it's his job.Rowling has a complex, interesting character on her hands - victim turned victimizer, Death Eater turned good, adult still nursing unhealed wounds from childhood, yet mature enough to put aside personal hatred to answer the call of duty - AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN REALIZE IT.  She still keeps trying to squeeze him into the mold she cast for him in the first book: the grown-up bully.The scene between Harry and Snape in the chapter ""Snape's Worst Memory,"" where Harry is too caught up in his own worries (what else is new?) about his father's character to show any compassion to Snape, is the book's great failing.  Yes, teenagers are moody and self-absorbed, but if Harry were as good as Rowling wants us to believe, this scene could have been the real coming-of-age in the novel: Harry could have realized that his supposed enemy was just a human being, that they have suffered the same things - he should have been moved to pity, and while it would have been grossly unrealistic for them to become bosom buddies, just a flicker of understanding from Harry could have started a crack in Snape's shell.",FALSE,2003,1504

The heroes are less heroic, the wizarding community--on the whole--is as prejudice and repressive as any society today and, quite frankly, Harry isn't nearly as likeable.

Books where names mean everything:  Albus (white) to Phoenix (reborn) to Sirius (the brightest star in the heavenly constellation Canis Major, while the character Sirius is the brightest star in his dark family) to Willy Widdershins (bent contrary to the sun/light).  In the Order of the Phoenix we learn that some things are worth dying for (says Sirius) and that just as the biblical Satan spreads ""enmity and discord"" so doth Lord Voldemort.  Everything is turned upside down, even at Hogwarts, when Evil--a liar and murderer from the beginning--is in power.  Harry is the subject of a true prophecy foretold; and his mind is tempted and manipulated by a powerful, evil figure.  Harry's defensive training of the mind against outside influence is weak, and Harry refuses to learn his teacher's technique resulting in the death of his Godfather.  (By definition, a Godparent is one who assumes responsibility for a child's faith.)  Naturally, Sirius would rather have Dumbledore (the only one Voldemort every feared) teach Harry these skills.  Not Snape.  (Both Snape and Harry could never forgive the other for past wrongs--yet Snape is given this task of defensive mind training.  Why?)  Dumbledore has a plan.  What happens when an evil figure tempts the mind?  He deceives, possesses and destroys before one can be saved--as Voldemort tries to do to Harry.  What protects Harry against this evil?

II, 8)As a child in his late thirties, I used to read Harry Potter every time I took a plane back home. His adventures would help me to kill time during the 9 hours flight to Europe. I must say I enjoyed the first volume of the series enormously, although I was disappointed by the denouement, which I found both laborious and quite predictable.The next year, I spent a couple of pleasant hours with the second volume too, but already most of the novelty was gone. I found that Rowling was quite unable to find new humorous details to lend a magical and poetic atmosphere to her narrative like the living photographs, the owl messengers etc., that had contributed so much to the charm of the ""Sorcerer's Stone"". The end of the story resembled that of the first volume in its predictability and complicated clumsiness.The third volume as it were brought all Rowling's weaknesses as a writer to a head, something I suspected when I noticed that the book was thicker that the preceding volumes. To tell the whole truth, I didn't bother to read the last chapter because I was thoroughly bored with the book and I left it on the floor of the plane. Needless to say, I didn't buy any more books by Rowling to enliven my following plane trips.What is wrong with the prisoner of Azkaban?My greatest criticism concerns the plot: it is so complicated that in the end the author is obliged to resort to the worst of all literary tricks: she has the characters explain the whole thing to the reader. This happens near the end of the book when the whole bunch is gathered in a haunted house in Hogsmeade, the wizarding village across the lake from Hogwart. I got completely lost in the lengthy and convoluted stories of the characters and came to the conclusion that Rowling was simply a bad writer running out of steam.The Prisoner of Azkaban is totally devoid of freshness and magic, it is a 100% deja vu thing. As a matter of fact, the atmosphere of the whole story is rather gloomy and dark. Clearly what you have here is an adult's world, not a children's world. It is also in keeping with what the author has said about the series, that it would become darker and darker...Other reviewers (for I am not the only one who finds this book a piece of rubbish !)have pointed to the use of a time machine by Hermione as a major flaw in the plot and I agree with them. In the previous episodes, I had also found Harry's invisibility clothes to be a kind of ""deus ex machina"" which made things just too easy for Rowling to round off her plot.I really had the impression that Rowling was writing just to sustain her reputation and keep the whole hugely lucrative Harry Potter circus going, while hammering the whole dubious witchcraft thing into her young readers'brains: the same oversimplified characters with the same stereotyped reactions, the same endless Quidditch matches, the same dreary mineral settings (talk of a book that brings children closer to nature!), the same laboured denouement. It is a routine! But it must be a highly hypnotic routine otherwise...how cold one explain the Hary Potter cult?What I find specially disappointing is Rowling's inability to describe a place or a character. The whole book is just dialogue and action, with minimum vocabulary. When I was 12, I read Rosny Aine's ""La Guerre du feu""(""The Quest for Fire""), a book full of long but enthralling descriptions of prehistoric swamps, mountains and forests: that is a real adventure book, believe me!Then and more importantly, there is the dubious PC ideology underlying the story. John Granger, in his ""Hidden Key to Harry Potter"" (I haven't read the book but I listened to the author on the Jeff rense radio program)cites the following passage as evidence that Rowling teaches children to take moral decisions: Dumbledore tells Harry: ""Now you have to choose between what is good and what is just easy"". For me, this is the best proof that there is an ethical flaw in the book, for any attentive person will recognize that the choice should be one between good and evil!And what about the pervasive elitism of the magician horde? Their inexplicable use of money and gold? In the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", I was bothered by the buying sprees (and drinking-bouts!)of Harry Potter's friends in Hogsmeade: is the author reminding her readers-in a not too subtle manner-to be good consumers? But what really angers me is the curriculum of the school: the children are taught practical skills but they are not taught any philosophy or religion to help them use these skills wisely. In effect Rowling seems to be telling her readership that you can have science without morality.Buy your child one of Tove Jansson's books for a change.

Why, for example, did he not have that wisdom tooth taken out? Couldn't he have done so with his magical powers? These are delicious details readers are simply clamoring for! To those who say the book's too lengthly, remember, the Brooklyn phone book is a mere page longer, and a much better read!",FALSE,2005,2199
"12014",2,731192,FALSE,"First there its a three year wait and I am a fan of Harry Potter and I thought, gosh three years late, should be worth the wait. She must really have something good stewing. But boy was i ever wrong! Not only was Harry moody all the time and Hermoine still on a frenzy about the elves and Ron sort of...too much like himself but without the laughs. Plus it was a bit slow at the begining and with one of the only people that Harry really cared for dying, i was deaply depressed while reading this book and the depressing Proffesser Umbridge, well, what can i say about this book that is really good. I mean series, most people think that it is good just because it is Harry Potter. I don't think so. Even a good serious can have its bad spells and I seriously hope that J.K.Rowling will get back on a ROWLing! If i was a mother I would refuse my children to read such a depressing story. Although my review doesn't sound too good i also have to say it was still well written and I spose it had a good twist but why, why didn't Harry...well you know...read the last chapter. ;)!",FALSE,2003,1471
"12020",3,731519,FALSE,"This book is a good one but not great, it explains lots of things that were there wandering. But compaired to the past 4 its long and boring, Harry is bitter all the time and there is not much action, hope the next one is better.",FALSE,2004,1798
"12022",2,731181,FALSE,"I was eager to read the fifth book, but I think its overly long, and needs editing. It moves slowly, too much non moving sideplots.  125 pages in and very little is known more than Voldemort has returned.Harry is whiny and cranky, all the characters seem to be bored with life. I understand that this is considered to be a return to  the style of the first book, but, in my opinion, it could be great, but it needs to be edited severely.",FALSE,2003,1460
